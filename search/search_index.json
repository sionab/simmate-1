We are working to move away from propriatary softwares and toward free/open-source codes like ABINIT, Quantum Espresso, or DFTK.jl. That way you can install Simmate and we will take care of the rest. This will take time though... so we recommend that fully experimental labs wait until Simmate hits this milestone. If you'd like to be notified when this occurs, send us an email at simmate.team@gmail.com. Before you begin \u00b6 If you are new to Simmate, jump over to our main website simmate.org and take a look at what we have to offer. This page is for when you're ready to use Simmate in your own research and access some advanced functionality. Our software is open-source and free to use, so come back to try it when you're ready! What is Simmate? \u00b6 The Simulated Materials Ecosystem (Simmate) is a toolbox and framework for computational materials research. It lets you explore various crystal databases, predict new materials, and quickly calculate properties (electronic, elastic, thermodynamic, and more). Computational research can be intimidating because there are so many programs to choose from, and it's hard to mix-and-match them for your specific project. Simmate aims to be the glue between all these different programs, databases, and utilities. We do the heavy lifting and explain these other programs to you along the way. Even if you consider yourself an experimentalist and have little-to-no coding experience, Simmate's barrier to entry is built to be as low as possible. Our web interface can generate property predictions with a single mouse click. And for learning how to code, we wrote our tutorials and documentation for those that have never used python before. At the other end of the spectrum, we provide an extremely powerful toolbox and API for experts. Those familiar with the field can view Simmate as an alternative to the Materials Project stack ( Atomate , PyMatGen , MatMiner , and more ), where we operate under a very different coding philosphy. Here, usability and readability are our top priorities. We therefore distribute Simmate as an \"all-in-one\" package rather than many separate programs. This includes a core material science toolkit, workflow management, database orm, and a website interface. Simmate also focuses heavily on cloud-based storage , which enables large scale collaborations and avoids researchers repeating calculations. To learn more about the different design choices made in Simmate compared to competing codes, read through our comparisons and benchmarks page . Installation \u00b6 Don't panic if you're new to coding and Python. When you're ready, head to our tutorials where we teach you everything from the beginning. If you're comfortable with Python, you can install Simmate with... conda install -c conda-forge simmate Note Simmate itself is <2MB, but when installed to a clean conda environment, the entire download for Simmate and all it's dependencies comes to ~1.2GB. Additional disk space is also needed for optional downloads -- such as third-party data . Running a Server \u00b6 Once installed, running a local test server is as simple as... # On first-time setup, you must intialize an empty database. simmate database reset # then start the server! simmate run-server After a few seconds, you can open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser to view your local server! Tip Read our website tutorials and documentation in order to switch to a production-ready server that's accessible through the internet and can be shared among a team. A Sneak-Peak of Features \u00b6 Again, take a look at our main website if you'd like to see the end-result of what Simmate has to offer. There are many more functions and utilities once you download Simmate, so this section showcases a few of those features. Prebuilt Workflows \u00b6 All of the most common material properties have workflows ready to go. These range from simple XRD pattern predictions to intensive dynamic simulations. Simmate also builds off of Prefect for orchestrating and managing workflows. This means that it's up to you whether to run jobs via (i) an advanced user-interface, (ii) the command-line, or (iii) in custom python scripts: command line yaml toml python # The command line let's you quickly run a workflow # from a structure file (CIF or POSCAR). simmate workflows run relaxation.vasp.matproj --structure NaCl.cif # Workflows can also be ran from YAML-based configuration # files, such as the one shown here (named `example.yaml`). # This would be submitted with the command: # `simmate workflows run example.yaml` workflow_name : relaxation.vasp.matproj structure : NaCl.cif command : mpirun -n 8 vasp_std > vasp.out # Workflows can also be ran from TOML-based configuration # files, such as the one shown here (named `example.toml`). # This would be submitted with the command: # `simmate workflows run example.toml` workflow_name = \"relaxation.vasp.matproj\" structure = \"NaCl.cif\" command = \"mpirun -n 8 vasp_std > vasp.out\" # Python let's you run workflows within scripts # which enables advanced setting configurations. from simmate.workflows.relaxation import Relaxation__Vasp__Matproj as workflow state = workflow . run ( structure = \"NaCl.cif\" ) result = state . result () Full-Feature Database \u00b6 Using all the data on our official site along with your own private data, you can take advantage of Simmate's extremely powerful database that is built off of Django ORM . Simmate also brings together third-party databases and their data -- including those like the COD, Materials Project, JARVIS, and others. With so much data, being able to easily download and navigate it is critical: # Be sure to follow the database tutorial where we build our # initial database with the command `simmate database reset` from simmate.database import connect from simmate.database.third_parties import MatprojStructure # EXAMPLE 1: all structures that have less than 6 sites in their unitcell structures = MatprojStructure . objects . filter ( nsites__lt = 6 ) . all () # EXAMPLE 2: complex filtering structures = MatprojStructure . objects . filter ( nsites__gte = 3 , # greater or equal to 3 sites energy__isnull = False , # the structure DOES have an energy density__range = ( 1 , 5 ), # density is between 1 and 5 elements__icontains = '\"C\"' , # the structure includes the element Carbon spacegroup__number = 167 , # the spacegroup number is 167 ) . all () # Quickly convert to excel, a pandas dataframe, or toolkit structures. df = structures . to_dataframe () structures = structures . to_toolkit () Utilities & Toolbox \u00b6 A lot of times in research, a new method is needed to analyze a structure, so a prebuilt workflow won't exist for you yet. Here, you'll need common functions ready to go (such as grabbing the volume of a crystal or running symmetry analysis). Our toolkit functions and classes largely inherit from PyMatGen , which gives you a wide variety of functions to use: # Load the structure file you'd like to use from simmate.toolkit import Structure structure = Structure . from_file ( \"NaCl.cif\" ) # Access a wide variety of properties. Here are some simple ones. structure . density structure . composition . reduced_formula structure . lattice . volume # Also access methods that run deformations or analysis on your structure. structure . make_supercell ([ 2 , 2 , 3 ]) structure . get_primitive_structure () structure . add_oxidation_state_by_guess () Scalable to Clusters \u00b6 At the beginning of a project, you may want to write and run code on a single computer and single core. But as you run into some intense calculations, you may want to use all of your CPU and GPU to run calculations. At the extreme, some projects require thousands of computers across numerous locations, including university clusters (using SLURM or PBS) and cloud computing (using Kubernetes and Docker). Simmate can meet all of these needs thanks to integration with a custom SimmateExecutor (the default), Dask , and/or Prefect : schedule jobs add remote resources # On your local computer, schedule your workflow run. # This is as easy as replacing \"run\" with \"run_cloud\". # This returns a \"future-like\" object. state = workflow . run_cloud ( ... ) # Calling result will wait until the job completes # and grab the result! Note, the job won't run # until you start a worker that is connected to the # same database (see command below) result = state . result () # In a separate terminal or even on a remote HPC cluster, you # can start a worker that will start running any scheduled jobs simmate workflow-engine start-worker Need help? \u00b6 Post your question here in our discussion section .

We therefore outline all unique parameters for all workflows here. To see which parameters are allowed for a given workflow, you can use the explore command or workflow.show_parameters() : command line python simmate workflows explore workflow . show_parameters () - angle_tolerance - command - compress_output - directory - is_restart - run_id - source - standardize_structure - structure - symmetry_precision If you need more details on a parameter or would like to request a new one, just let us know! You can then search for these parameters below to learn more about them. angle_tolerance \u00b6 If standardize_structure=True, then this is the cutoff value used to determine if the angles between sites are symmetrically equivalent. (in Degrees) yaml toml python angle_tolerance : 10.0 angle_tolerance = 10.0 angle_tolerance = 10.0 chemical_system \u00b6 The chemical system to be used in the analysis. This should be given as a string and in the format Element1-Element2-Element3-... . For example, Na-Cl , Y-C , and Y-C-F are valid chemical systems. yaml toml python chemical_system : Na-Cl chemical_system = \"Na-Cl\" chemical_system = \"Na-Cl\" Warning Some workflows only accept a chemical system with a specific number of elements. An example of this is the structure-prediction.python.binary-composition search which only allows two elements (e.g. Y-C-F would raise an error) command \u00b6 The command that will be called during execution of a program. There is typically a default set for this that you only need to change unless you'd like parallelization. For example, VASP workflows use vasp_std > vasp.out by default but you can override this to use mpirun . yaml toml python command : mpirun -n 8 vasp_std > vasp.out command = \"mpirun -n 8 vasp_std > vasp.out\" command = \"mpirun -n 8 vasp_std > vasp.out\" composition \u00b6 The composition input can be anything compatible with the Composition toolkit class. Note that compositions are sensitive to atom counts / multiplicity. There is a difference between giving Ca2N and Ca4N2 in several workflows. Accepted inputs include: a string (recommended) yaml toml python composition : Ca2NF composition = \"Ca2NF\" composition = \"Ca2NF\" a dictionary that gives the composition yaml toml python composition : Ca : 2 N : 1 F : 1 [ composition ] Ca = 2 N = 1 F = 1 composition = { \"Ca\" : 2 , \"N\" : 1 , \"F\" : 1 , } a Composition object (best for advanced logic) python from simmate.toolkit import Compositon composition = Composition ( \"Ca2NF\" ) json/dictionary serialization from pymatgen compress_output \u00b6 Whether to compress the directory to a zip file at the end of the run. After compression, it will also delete the directory. The default is False. yaml toml python compress_output : true compress_output = true compress_output = True convergence_limit \u00b6 For evolutionary searches, the search will be considered converged when the best structure is not changing by this amount (in eV). In order to officially signal the end of the search, the best structure must survive within this convergence limit for a specific number of new individuals -- this is controlled by the limit_best_survival . The default of 1meV is typically sufficient and does not need to be changed. More often, users should update limit_best_survival instead. yaml toml python convergence_limit : 0.005 convergence_limit = 0.005 convergence_limit = 0.005 copy_previous_directory \u00b6 Whether to copy the directory from the previous calculation (if there is one) and then use it as a starting point for this new calculation. This is only possible if you provided an input that points to a previous calculation. For example, structure would need to use a database-like input: yaml toml python structure : database_table : Relaxation database_id : 123 copy_previous_directory : true copy_previous_directory : true [structure] database_table = \"Relaxation\" database_id = 123 structure = { \"database_table\" : \"Relaxation\" , \"database_id\" : 123 } copy_previous_directory = True The default is False , and it is not recommended to use this in existing workflows. Nested workflows that benefit from this feature use it automatically. diffusion_analysis_id \u00b6 (advanced users only) The entry id from the DiffusionAnalysis table to link the results to. This is set automatically by higher-level workflows and rarely (if ever) set by the user. directory \u00b6 The directory to run everything in -- either as a relative or full path. This is passed to the ulitities function simmate.ulitities.get_directory , which generates a unique foldername if not provided (such as simmate-task-12390u243 ). This will be converted into a pathlib.Path object. Accepted inputs include: leave as default (recommended) a string yaml toml python directory : my-new-folder-00 directory = \"my-new-folder-00\" directory = \"my-new-folder-00\" a pathlib.Path (best for advanced logic) python from pathlib import Path directory = Path ( \"my-new-folder-00\" ) directory_new \u00b6 Unique to the restart.simmate.automatic workflow, this is the folder that the workflow will be continued in. Follows the same rules/inputs as the directory parameter. directory_old \u00b6 Unique to the restart.simmate.automatic workflow, this is the original folder that should be used at the starting point. Follows the same rules/inputs as the directory parameter. fitness_field \u00b6 (advanced users only) For evolutionary searches, this is the value that should be optimized. Specifically, it should minimized this value (lower value = better fitness). The default is energy_per_atom , but you may want to set this to a custom column in a custom database table. input_parameters \u00b6 (experimental feature) Unique to customized.vasp.user-config . This is a list of parameters to pass to workflow_base . is_restart \u00b6 (experimental feature) Whether the calculation is a restarted workflow run. Default is False. If set to true, the workflow will go through the given directory (which must be provided) and see where to pick up. yaml toml python directory : my-old-calc-folder is_restart : true directory = \"my-old-calc-folder\" is_restart = true directory = \"my-old-calc-folder\" is_restart = True limit_best_survival \u00b6 For evolutionary searches, fixed compositions will be stopped when the best individual remains unbeaten for this number of new individuals. In order to absorb similar structures (e.g. identical structures but with minor energy differences), structures within the convergence_limit parameter (e.g. +1meV) are not considered when counting historical structures. This helps to prevent the search from continuing in cases where the search is likely already converged but making <0.1meV improvements. The default is typically set based on the number of atoms in the composition. yaml toml python limit_best_survival : 100 limit_best_survival = 100 limit_best_survival = 100 max_atoms \u00b6 For workflows that involve generating a supercell or random structure, this will be the maximum number of sites to allow in the generate structure(s). For example, NEB workflows would set this value to something like 100 atoms to limit their supercell image sizes. Alternatively, a evolutionary search may set this to 10 atoms to limit the compositions & stoichiometries that are explored. yaml toml python max_atoms : 100 max_atoms = 100 max_atoms = 100 max_structures \u00b6 For workflows that generate new structures (and potentially run calculations on them), this will be the maximum number of structures allowed. The workflow will end at this number of structures regardless of whether the calculation/search is converged or not. yaml toml python max_structures : 100 max_structures = 100 max_structures = 100 migrating_specie \u00b6 This is the atomic species/element that will be moving in the analysis (typically NEB or MD diffusion calculations). Note, oxidation states (e.g. \"Ca2+\") can be used, but this requires your input structure to be oxidation-state decorated as well. yaml toml python migrating_specie : Li migrating_specie = \"Li\" migrating_specie = \"Li\" migration_hop \u00b6 (advanced users only) The atomic path that should be analyzed. Inputs are anything compatible with the MigrationHop class of the simmate.toolkit.diffusion module. This includes: MigrationHop object a database entry in the MigrationHop table (TODO: if you'd like full examples, please ask our team to add them) migration_hop_id \u00b6 (advanced users only) The entry id from the MigrationHop table to link the results to. This is set automatically by higher-level workflows and rarely (if ever) set by the user. If used, you'll likely need to set diffusion_analysis_id as well. migration_images \u00b6 The full set of images (including endpoint images) that should be analyzed. Inputs are anything compatible with the MigrationImages class of the simmate.toolkit.diffusion module, which is effectively a list of structure inputs. This includes: MigrationImages object a list of Structure objects a list of filenames (cif or POSCAR) yaml toml python migration_images : - image_01.cif - image_02.cif - image_03.cif - image_04.cif - image_05.cif migration_images = [ \"image_01.cif\" , \"image_02.cif\" , \"image_03.cif\" , \"image_04.cif\" , \"image_05.cif\" , ] migration_images = [ \"image_01.cif\" , \"image_02.cif\" , \"image_03.cif\" , \"image_04.cif\" , \"image_05.cif\" , ] min_atoms \u00b6 This is the opposite of max_atoms as this will be the minimum number of sites to allow in the generate structure(s). See max_atoms for details. min_length \u00b6 When generating a supercell, this is the minimum length for each lattice vector of the generate cell (in Angstroms). yaml toml python min_length : 7.5 min_length = 7.5 min_length = 7.5 nfirst_generation \u00b6 For evolutionary searches, no mutations or \"child\" individuals will be scheduled until this number of individuals have been calculated. This ensures we have a good pool of candidates calculated before we start selecting parents and mutating them. yaml toml python nfirst_generation : 15 nfirst_generation = 15 nfirst_generation = 15 nimages \u00b6 The number of images (or structures) to use in the analysis. This does NOT include the endpoint images (start/end structures). More is better, but computationally expensive. We recommend keeping this value odd in order to ensure there is an image at the midpoint. yaml toml python nimages : 5 nimages = 5 nimages = 5 Danger For calculators such as VASP, your command parameter must use a number of cores that is divisible by nimages . For example, nimages=3 and command=\"mpirun -n 10 vasp_std > vasp.out\" will fail because 10 is not divisible by 3. nsteadystate \u00b6 The number of individual workflows to have scheduled at once. This therefore sets the queue size of an evolutionary search. Note, the number of workflows ran in parallel is determined by the number of Workers started (i.e. starting 3 workers will run 3 workflows in parallel, even if 100 workflows are in the queue). The steady-state does, however, set the maximum number of parallel runs because the queue size will never exceed the nsteadystate value. This parameter is closely tied with steadystate_sources , so be sure to read about that parameter as well. yaml toml python nsteadystate : 50 nsteadystate = 50 nsteadystate = 50 nsteps \u00b6 The total number of steps to run the calculation on. For example, in molecular dynamics workflows, this will stop the simulation after this many steps. yaml toml python nsteps : 10000 nsteps = 10000 nsteps = 10000 run_id \u00b6 The id assigned to a specific workflow run / calculation. If not provided this will be randomly generated, and we highly recommended leaving this at the default value. Note, this is based on unique-ids (UUID), so every id should be 100% unique and in a string format. yaml toml python run_id : my-unique-id-123 run_id = \"my-unique-id-123\" run_id = \"my-unique-id-123\" search_id \u00b6 (advanced users only) The evolutionary search that this individual is associated with. This allows us to determine which Selector , Validator , and StopCondition should be used when creating and evaluating the individual. When running a search, this is set automatically when submitting a new flow. selector_kwargs \u00b6 (advanced users only) Extra conditions to use when initializing the selector class. MySelector(**selector_kwargs) . The input should be given as a dictionary. Note, for evolutionary searches, the composition kwarg is added automatically. This is closely tied with the selector_name parameter so be sure to read that section as well. selector_name \u00b6 (experimental feature; advanced users only) The base selector class that should be used. The class will be initialized using MySelector(**selector_kwargs) . The input should be given as a string. Warning Currently, we only support truncated selection, so this should be left at its default value. singleshot_sources \u00b6 (experimental feature; advanced users only) A list of structure sources that run once and never again. This includes generating input structures from known structures (from third-party databases), prototypes, or substituiting known structures. In the current version of simmate, these features are not enabled and this input should be ignored. sleep_step \u00b6 When there is a cycle within a workflow (such as iteratively checking the number of subworkflows submitted and updating results), this is the amount of time in seconds that the workflow will shutdown before restarting the cycle. For evolutionary searches, setting this to a larger value will save on computation resources and database load, so we recommend increasing it where possible. yaml toml python run_id : 180 run_id = 180 sleep_step = 180 # 3 minutes source \u00b6 (experimental feature; advanced users only) This column indicates where the input data (and other parameters) came from. The source could be a number of things including... - a third party id - a structure from a different Simmate datbase table - a transformation of another structure - a creation method - a custom submission by the user By default, this is a dictionary to account for the many different scenarios. Here are some examples of values used in this column: python # from a thirdparty database or separate table source = { \"database_table\" : \"MatprojStructure\" , \"database_id\" : \"mp-123\" , } # from a random structure creator source = { \"creator\" : \"PyXtalStructure\" } # from a templated structure creator (e.g. substituition or prototypes) source = { \"creator\" : \"PrototypeStructure\" , \"database_table\" : \"AFLOWPrototypes\" , \"id\" : 123 , } # from a transformation source = { \"transformation\" : \"MirrorMutation\" , \"database_table\" : \"MatprojStructure\" , \"parent_ids\" : [ \"mp-12\" , \"mp-34\" ], } Typically, the source is set automatically, and users do not need to update it. standardize_structure \u00b6 In some cases, we may want to standardize the structure during our setup(). This means running symmetry analysis on the structure in order to reduce the symmetry and also convert it to some standardized form. There are three different forms to choose from and thus 3 different values that standardize_structure can be set to: primitive : for the standard primitive unitcell conventional : for the standard conventional unitcell primitive-LLL : for the standard primitive unitcell that is then LLL-reduced False : this is the default and will disable this feature We recommend using primitive-LLL when the smallest possible and most cubic unitcell is desired. We recommend using primitive when calculating band structures and ensuring we have a standardized high-symmetry path. Note,Existing band-structure workflows use this automatically. To control the tolerances used to symmetrize the structure, you can use the symmetry_precision and angle_tolerance attributes. By default, no standardization is applied. yaml toml python standardize_structure : primitive-LLL standardize_structure = \"primitive-LLL\" standardize_structure = \"primitive-LLL\" steadystate_sources \u00b6 (experimental feature; advanced users only) The sources that will be scheduled at a \"steady-state\", meaning there will always be a set number of individuals scheduled/running for this type of structure source. This should be defined as a dictionary where each is {\"source_name\": percent} . The percent determines the number of steady stage calculations that will be running for this at any given time. It will be a percent of the nsteadystate parameter, which sets the total number of individuals to be scheduled/running. For example, if nsteadystate=40 and we add a source of {\"RandomSymStructure\": 0.30, ...} , this means 0.25*40=10 randomly-created individuals will be running/submitted at all times. The source can be from either the toolkit.creator or toolkit.transformations modules. yaml yaml python singleshot_sources : RandomSymStructure : 0.30 from_ase.Heredity : 0.30 from_ase.SoftMutation : 0.10 from_ase.MirrorMutation : 0.10 from_ase.LatticeStrain : 0.05 from_ase.RotationalMutation : 0.05 from_ase.AtomicPermutation : 0.05 from_ase.CoordinatePerturbation : 0.05 [ singleshot_sources ] \"RandomSymStructure\" : 0.30 \"from_ase.Heredity\" : 0.30 \"from_ase.SoftMutation\" : 0.10 \"from_ase.MirrorMutation\" : 0.10 \"from_ase.LatticeStrain\" : 0.05 \"from_ase.RotationalMutation\" : 0.05 \"from_ase.AtomicPermutation\" : 0.05 \"from_ase.CoordinatePerturbation\" : 0.05 singleshot_sources = { \"RandomSymStructure\" : 0.30 , \"from_ase.Heredity\" : 0.30 , \"from_ase.SoftMutation\" : 0.10 , \"from_ase.MirrorMutation\" : 0.10 , \"from_ase.LatticeStrain\" : 0.05 , \"from_ase.RotationalMutation\" : 0.05 , \"from_ase.AtomicPermutation\" : 0.05 , \"from_ase.CoordinatePerturbation\" : 0.05 , } Note: if your percent values do not sum to 1, they will be rescaled. When calculating percent*nsteadystate , the value will be rounded to the nearest integer. We are moving towards accepting kwargs or class objects as well, but this is not yet allowed. For example, anything other than percent would be treated as a kwarg: toml [singleshot_sources.RandomSymStructure] percent : 0.30 spacegroups_exclude : [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] site_generation_method : \"MyCustomMethod\" structure \u00b6 The crystal structure to be used for the analysis. The input can be anything compatible with the Structure toolkit class. Accepted inputs include: a filename (cif or poscar) (recommended) yaml toml python structure : NaCl.cif structure = NaCl . cif structure = \"NaCl.cif\" a dictionary that points to a database entry. yaml toml python # example 1 structure : database_table : MatprojStructure database_id : mp-123 # example 2 structure : database_table : StaticEnergy database_id : 50 # example 3 structure : database_table : Relaxation database_id : 50 structure_field : structure_final # example 1 [structure] database_table : MatprojStructure database_id : mp-123 # example 2 [structure] database_table : StaticEnergy database_id : 50 # example 3 [structure] database_table : Relaxation database_id : 50 structure_field : structure_final # example 1 structure = { \"database_table\" : \"MatprojStructure\" , \"database_id\" : \"mp-123\" , } # example 2 structure = { \"database_table\" : \"StaticEnergy\" , \"database_id\" : 50 , } # example 3 structure = { \"database_table\" : \"Relaxation\" , \"database_id\" : 50 , \"structure_field\" : \"structure_final\" , } Note instead of database_id , you can also use the run_id or directory to indicate which entry to load. Further, if the database table is linked to multiple structures (e.g. relaxations have a structure_start and structure_final ), then you can also add the structure_field to specify which to choose. a Structure object (best for advanced logic) python from simmate.toolkit import Structure structure = Structure ( lattice = [ [ 2.846 , 2.846 , 0.000 ], [ 2.846 , 0.000 , 2.846 ], [ 0.000 , 2.846 , 2.846 ], ], species = [ \"Na\" , \"Cl\" ], coords = [ [ 0.5 , 0.5 , 0.5 ], [ 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 ], ], coords_are_cartesian = False , ) json/dictionary serialization from pymatgen structure_source_id \u00b6 (advanced users only) The structure source that this individual is associated with. This allows us to determine how the new individual should be created. When running a search, this is set automatically when submitting a new flow. subworkflow_kwargs \u00b6 Make sure you read about subworkflow_name parameter first. This is a dictionary of parameters to pass to each subworkflow run. For example, the workflow will be ran as subworkflow.run(**subworkflow_kwargs) . Note, many workflows that use this argument will automatically pass information that is unique to each call (such as structure ). yaml toml python subworkflow_kwargs : command : mpirun -n 4 vasp_std > vasp.out compress_output : true [subworkflow_kwargs] command = \"mpirun -n 4 vasp_std > vasp.out\" compress_output = true subworkflow_kwargs = dict ( command = \"mpirun -n 4 vasp_std > vasp.out\" , compress_output = True , ) subworkflow_name \u00b6 The name of workflow that used to evaluate structures generated. For example, in evolutionary searches, individuals are created and then relaxed using the relaxation.vasp.staged workflow. Any workflow that is registered and accessible via the get_workflow utility can be used instead. (note: in the future we will allow unregisterd flows as well). If you wish to submit extra arguments to each workflow run, you can use the subworkflow_kwargs parameter. yaml toml python subworkflow_name : relaxation.vasp.staged subworkflow_name = \"relaxation.vasp.staged\" subworkflow_name = \"relaxation.vasp.staged\" supercell_end \u00b6 The endpoint image supercell to use.

Workers should be started with matching tags in order for these scheduled flows to run. yaml toml python tags : - my-tag-01 - my-tag-02 tags = [ \"my-tag-01\" , \"my-tag-02\" ] tags = [ \"my-tag-01\" , \"my-tag-02\" ] temperature_end \u00b6 For molecular dynamics simulations, this is the temperature to end the simulation at (in Kelvin). This temperatue will be reached through a linear transition from the temperature_start parameter. yaml toml python temperature_end : 1000 temperature_end = 1000 temperature_end = 1000 temperature_start \u00b6 For molecular dynamics simulations, this is the temperature to begin the simulation at (in Kelvin). yaml toml python temperature_start : 250 temperature_start = 250 temperature_start = 250 time_step \u00b6 For molecular dynamics simulations, this is time time between each ionic step (in femtoseconds). yaml toml python time_step : 1.5 time_step = 1.5 time_step = 1.5 updated_settings \u00b6 (experimental feature) Unique to customized.vasp.user-config . This is a list of parameters to update the workflow_base with. This often involves updating the base class attributes. validator_kwargs \u00b6 (advanced users only) Extra conditions to use when initializing the validator class. MyValidator(**validator_kwargs) . The input should be given as a dictionary. Note, for evolutionary searches, the composition kwarg is added automatically. This is closely tied with the validator_name parameter so be sure to read that section as well. validator_name \u00b6 (experimental feature; advanced users only) The base validator class that should be used. The class will be initialized using MyValidator(**validator_kwargs) . The input should be given as a string. Warning Currently, we only support CrystallNNFingerprint validation, so this should be left at its default value. workflow_base \u00b6 (experimental feature) Unique to customized.vasp.user-config . This is the base workflow to use when updating critical settings. write_summary_files \u00b6 Whether or not to write output files. For some workflows, writing output files can cause excessive load on the database and possibly make the calculation IO bound. In cases such as this, you can set this to False . yaml toml python write_summary_files : false write_summary_files = false write_summary_files = False Tip Beginners can often ignore this setting.

Users should instead use the load_remote_archive method to access data. See the database docs . This module is for pulling data from various databases into Simmate using third-party codes. This can then be used to build archives that users may access. Benefits of adding your data to Simmate \u00b6 When deciding whether your team should use Simmate, we can break down discussion to two key questions: Can you benefit from converting data into a Simmate format? Can you benefit from distributing an archive? (private or public) We will answer these questions in the next two sections. Converting data into a Simmate format \u00b6 Whether your data is open-source or proprietary, the answer to question 1 will be the same: Providers can benefit from using Simmate's database module because it... automatically builds an API and ORM for your data greatly reduces the file size of your archives By providing raw data (like a structure or energy), Simmate will automatically expand your data into the most useful columns, and you can then use our ORM to query data rapidly. For example, Simmate can use an energy column/field to create columns for energy_above_hull , formation_energy , decomposes_to , and more -- then you can filter through your data using these new columns. See the \"Querying Data\" section in the simmate.database module for examples of this query language. Using the concepts of \"raw data\" vs \"secondary columns\" (columns that can be rapidly remade/calculated using the raw data), Simmate can efficiently compress your data to a small format. To see just how small, check out the file sizes for archives of current providers: Provider Number of Structures Av. Sites per Structure Archive Size JARVIS 55,712 ~10 8.0 MB Materials Project 137,885 ~30 45.2 MB COD 471,664 ~248 1.16 GB OQMD 1,013,521 ~7 79.2 MB AFLOW n/a n/a n/a (Note, COD experiences poor compression because Simmate has not yet optimized storage for disordered structures.) These small file sizes will make it much easier for downloading and sharing your data. This can have major savings on your database server as well. Hosting & distributing the archive \u00b6 Here is where being a private vs. open-source provider becomes important. Simmate lets you to decide how others access your data. If your data can only be accessible to among your own team members or subscribers, then you can be in charge of distruting the data (via a CDN, dropbox, etc.). Simmate does not require that you distribute your data freely -- though we do encourage open-source data. Either way, you can benefit from... lessening the load on your own web APIs Server load can be reduced because, in Simmate, users download your archive once and then have the data stored locally for as long as they'd like. New users often want to download a massive portion a database (or all of it) -- and also do so repeatedly as they learn about APIs, so using Simmate archives upfront can save your team from these large and often-repeated queries. If you are fine with making your data freely available, you can further benefit by... skipping the setup of up your own server and instead use Simmate's for free exposing your data to the Simmate user base Providers that permit redistribution are welcome to use our CDN for their archives. This only requires contacting our team and making this request. Further, once your archive is configured, all Simmate users will be able to easily access your data. How to add your data or a new provider \u00b6 Tip If you want to avoid this guide, you can just contact our team! Open a github issue to get our attention. In most cases, we only need a CSV or JSON file of your data (in any data format you'd like), and we can handle the rest for you. If you'd like to contribute the data on your own, keep reading. The end goal for each provider is to allow a user do the following: from simmate.database import connect from simmate.third_parties import ExampleProviderData ExampleProviderData . load_remote_archive () search_results = ExampleProviderData . objects . filter ( ... ) . all () # plus all to_dataframe / to_toolkit features discussed elsewhere The key part that providers must understand is the load_remote_archive method. This method... loads an archive of available data (as a zip file from some CDN) unpacks the data into the Simmate format saves everything to the user's database (by defualt this is ~/simmate/database.sqlite3 ). This guide serves to make the first step work! Specifically, providers must make the archive that load_remote_archive will load in step 1 and make it downloadable by a CDN or API endpoint. It is up to the provider whether they personally distribute the archive or allow Simmate to distribute it for them. Outline of steps \u00b6 To illustrate how this is done, we will walk through the required steps: Define a Simmate table Download data into the Simmate format (i.e. populate the Simmate table) Compress the data to archive file Make the archive available via a CDN Link the CDN to the Simmate table Tip these steps involve contributing changes to Simmate's code, so we recommend opening a github issue before starting too. That way, our team can help you through this process. If you are new to Github and contributing, be sure to read our tutorial for contributors too. Step 1: Define a Simmate table \u00b6 To host data, Simmate must first know what kind of data you are going to host. We do this by adding a new file to the simmate.database.third_party module. You can view this folder on github here . Start by defining a DatabaseTable with any custom columns / database mix-ins. You can scroll through the other providers to see how tables are made. Good examples to view are for JARVIS and Materials Project . Here is a template with useful comments to get you started: # Start by deciding which base data types you can include. Here, we include a # crystal structure and an energy, so we use the Structure and Thermodynamics # mix-ins. from simmate.database.base_data_types import ( table_column , Structure , Thermodynamics , ) class ExampleProviderData ( Structure , Thermodynamics ): # ----- Table columns + Required settings ----- # This Meta class tells Simmate where to store the table within our database. # All providers with have the exact same thing here. class Meta : app_label = \"third_parties\" # By default, the ID column is an IntegerField, but if your data uses a string # like \"mp-1234\" to denote structures, you can update this column to # accept a string instead. id = table_column . CharField ( max_length = 25 , primary_key = True ) # Write the name of your team here! source = \"The Example Provider Project\" # We have many alerts to let users know they should cite you. Add the DOI # that you'd like them to cite here. source_doi = \"https://doi.org/...\" # If you have any custom fields that you'd like to add, list them off here. # All data types supported by Django are also supported by Simmate. You can # view those options here: # https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/models/fields/ custom_column_01 = table_column . FloatField ( blank = True , null = True ) custom_column_02 = table_column . BooleanField ( blank = True , null = True ) # Leave this as None for now. We will update this attribute in a later step. remote_archive_link = None # ----- Extra optionalfeatures ----- # (OPTIONAL) Define the \"raw data\" for your table. This is required if # you'd like to use the `to_archive` method. Fields from the mix-in # will automatically be added. archive_fields = [ \"custom_column_01\" , \"custom_column_02\" , ] # (OPTIONAL) Define how you would like data to be accessible in the REST # API from the website server. api_filters = { \"custom_column_01\" : [ \"range\" ], \"custom_column_02\" : [ \"range\" ], } # (OPTIONAL) if you host your data on a separate website, you can specify # how to access that structure here. This is important if you want users # to switch to your site for aquiring additional data. @property def external_link ( self ) -> str : return f \"https://www.exampleprovider.com/structure/ { self . id } \" Before moving on, make sure your table was configured properly by doing the following: # in the command line simmate database reset # in python from simmate.database import connect from simmate.third_parties import ExampleProviderData # This will show you all the columns for your table ExampleProviderData . show_columns () # this will show you exactly what the table looks like my_table = ExampleProviderData . objects . to_dataframe () Step 2: Download data into the Simmate format \u00b6 Now that Simmate knows what to expect, we can load your data into the database. This can be done in serveral ways. It is entirely up to you which method to use, but here are our recommended options: JSON or CSV file. If all of your data can be provide via a dump file, then we can use that! This is typically the easiest for a provider's server. For an example of this, see the COD implementation, which uses a download of CIF files. A custom python package. Feel free to add an optional dependency if your team has already put a lot of work into loading data using a python package. A great example of this is the MPRester class in pymatgen, which we use to pull Material Project data. (JARVIS, AFLOW, OQMD currently use this option too). REST API or GraphQL. If you have a web API, we can easily pull data using the python requests package. Note, in many cases, a REST API is an inefficient way to pull data - as it involves querying a database thousands of times (once for each page of structures) -- potentially crashing the server. In cases like that, we actually prefer a download file (option 1, shown above). OPTIMADE endpoint. This is a standardized REST API endpoint that many databases are using now. The huge upside here is that each database will have a matching API -- so once your team has an OPTIMADE endpoint, we can pull data into Simmate with ease. There's no need to build a 2nd implementation. The downside is the same as option 3: OPTIMADE doesn't have a good way to pull data in bulk. Their team is currently working on this though . Web scraping. As an absolute last resort, we can use requests to scrape webpages for data (or selenium in even more extreme cases.). This requires the most work from our team and is also the least efficient way to grab data. Therefore, scraping should always be avoided if possible. With your data in hand, you will now add a file that saves data to the local simmate database on your computer. This file can be added to the for_providers module ( here ). However, if you want your data and it's access to remain private, you can also keep this file out of Simmate's source-code. It's up to you, but we encourage providers to host their file in the Simmate repo -- so we can give feedback and so future providers can use it as an example/guide. Either way, here is a template of how that file will look like: from django.db import transaction from rich.progress import track from simmate.toolkit import Structure from simmate.database.third_parties import ExampleProviderData # If you want to use a custom package to load your data, be sure to let our team # know how to install it. try : from my_package.db import get_my_data except : raise ModuleNotFoundError ( \"You must install my_package with `conda install -c conda-forge my_package`\" ) # We make this an \"atomic transaction\", which means if any error is encountered # while saving results to the database, then the database will be reset to it's # original state. Adding this decorator is optional @transaction . atomic def load_all_structures (): # Use whichever method you chose above to load all of your data! # Here' we are pretending to use a function that loads all data into a # python dictionary, but this can vary. data = get_my_data () # Now iterate through all the data -- which is a list of dictionaries. # We use rich.progress.track to monitor progress. for entry in track ( data ): # The structure is in the atoms field as a dictionary. We pull this data # out and convert it to a toolkit Structure object. Note, this class # is currently a subclass of pymatgen.Structure, so it supports reading # from different file formats (like CIF or POSCAR) as well. structure = Structure ( lattice = entry [ \"atoms\" ][ \"lattice_mat\" ], species = entry [ \"atoms\" ][ \"elements\" ], coords = entry [ \"atoms\" ][ \"coords\" ], coords_are_cartesian = entry [ \"atoms\" ][ \"cartesian\" ], ) # Now that we have a structure object, we can feed that and all # other data to the from_toolkit() method. This will create a database # object in the Simmate format. Note the data we pass here is based on # the ExampleProviderData we defined in the other file. structure_db = ExampleProviderData . from_toolkit ( id = entry [ \"my_id\" ], structure = structure , # required by Structure mix-in energy = entry [ \"my_final_energy\" ], # required by Thermodynamics mix-in custom_column_01 = entry [ \"my_custom_column_01\" ], # The get method is useful if not all entries have a given field. custom_column_02 = entry . get ( \"my_custom_column_02\" ), ) # and save it to our database! structure_db . save () Try running this on your dataset (or a subset of data if you want to quickly test things). When it finishes, you can ensure data was loaded properly by running: # in python from simmate.database import connect from simmate.third_parties import ExampleProviderData # Check that the number of rows matches your source data. total_entries = ExampleProviderData . objects . count () # View the data! # The [:100] limits this to your first 100 results my_table = ExampleProviderData . objects . to_dataframe ()[: 100 ] And that's it for writing new code! All that's left is making your data available for others. Step 3: Compress the data to archive file \u00b6 This will be the easiest step yet. We need to make a zip file for users to download, which can be done in one line: ExampleProviderData . objects . to_archive () You'll find a file named ExampleProviderData-2022-01-25.zip (but with the current date) in your working directory. The date is for timestamp and versioning your archives. Because archives are a snapshot of databases that may be dynamically changing/going, this timestamp helps users know which version they are on. You can practice reloading this data into your database too: Make a copy of your database file in ~/simmate/ so you don't lose your work In the terminal, reset your database with simmate database reset In python, try reloading your data with ExampleProviderData.load_archive() Try viewing your data again with ExampleProviderData.objects.to_dataframe() Step 4: Make the archive available via a CDN \u00b6 Users with now need the archive file you made to access your data. So you must decide: how should this zip file be downloaded by users? If you give Simmate approval, we can host your archive file on our own servers. Otherwise you must host your own. The only requirement for your host server is that the zip file can be downloaded from a URL. While we encourage open-source databases, if you consider your dataset private or commercial, Simmate does not require any payment or involvement for how this CDN is hosted and maintained. Thus, you can manage access to this URL via a subscription or any other method. However, Simmate's CDNs are reserved for archives that are freely distributed. Note: when uploading new versions of your archive, you should keep the outdated archive either available via its previous URL or, at a minimum, available upon request from users. Step 5: Link the CDN to the Simmate table \u00b6 In Step 1, we left one attribute as None in our code: remote_archive_link . As a final step, you need to take the URL that you're host your zip file at and paste it here. For example, that line will become: remote_archive_link = \"https://archives.simmate.org/ExampleProviderData-2022-01-25.zip\" That's it! Let's test out everything again. Note, we are now using load_remote_archive in this process -- which will load your zip file from the URL. Make a copy of your database file in ~/simmate/ so you don't lose your work In the terminal, reset your database with simmate database reset In python, try reloading your data with ExampleProviderData.load_remote_archive() Try viewing your data again with ExampleProviderData.objects.to_dataframe() If you've made it this far, thank you for contributing!!! Your data is now easily accessible to all Simmate users, which we hope facilitates its use and even lessen the load on your own servers.

Here is a template with useful comments to get you started: # Start by deciding which base data types you can include.

This can be done in serveral ways. It is entirely up to you which method to use, but here are our recommended options: JSON or CSV file. If all of your data can be provide via a dump file, then we can use that! This is typically the easiest for a provider's server. For an example of this, see the COD implementation, which uses a download of CIF files. A custom python package. Feel free to add an optional dependency if your team has already put a lot of work into loading data using a python package. A great example of this is the MPRester class in pymatgen, which we use to pull Material Project data. (JARVIS, AFLOW, OQMD currently use this option too). REST API or GraphQL. If you have a web API, we can easily pull data using the python requests package. Note, in many cases, a REST API is an inefficient way to pull data - as it involves querying a database thousands of times (once for each page of structures) -- potentially crashing the server. In cases like that, we actually prefer a download file (option 1, shown above). OPTIMADE endpoint. This is a standardized REST API endpoint that many databases are using now. The huge upside here is that each database will have a matching API -- so once your team has an OPTIMADE endpoint, we can pull data into Simmate with ease. There's no need to build a 2nd implementation. The downside is the same as option 3: OPTIMADE doesn't have a good way to pull data in bulk. Their team is currently working on this though . Web scraping. As an absolute last resort, we can use requests to scrape webpages for data (or selenium in even more extreme cases.). This requires the most work from our team and is also the least efficient way to grab data. Therefore, scraping should always be avoided if possible. With your data in hand, you will now add a file that saves data to the local simmate database on your computer. This file can be added to the for_providers module ( here ). However, if you want your data and it's access to remain private, you can also keep this file out of Simmate's source-code. It's up to you, but we encourage providers to host their file in the Simmate repo -- so we can give feedback and so future providers can use it as an example/guide. Either way, here is a template of how that file will look like: from django.db import transaction from rich.progress import track from simmate.toolkit import Structure from simmate.database.third_parties import ExampleProviderData # If you want to use a custom package to load your data, be sure to let our team # know how to install it. try : from my_package.db import get_my_data except : raise ModuleNotFoundError ( \"You must install my_package with `conda install -c conda-forge my_package`\" ) # We make this an \"atomic transaction\", which means if any error is encountered # while saving results to the database, then the database will be reset to it's # original state. Adding this decorator is optional @transaction . atomic def load_all_structures (): # Use whichever method you chose above to load all of your data! # Here' we are pretending to use a function that loads all data into a # python dictionary, but this can vary. data = get_my_data () # Now iterate through all the data -- which is a list of dictionaries. # We use rich.progress.track to monitor progress. for entry in track ( data ): # The structure is in the atoms field as a dictionary. We pull this data # out and convert it to a toolkit Structure object. Note, this class # is currently a subclass of pymatgen.Structure, so it supports reading # from different file formats (like CIF or POSCAR) as well. structure = Structure ( lattice = entry [ \"atoms\" ][ \"lattice_mat\" ], species = entry [ \"atoms\" ][ \"elements\" ], coords = entry [ \"atoms\" ][ \"coords\" ], coords_are_cartesian = entry [ \"atoms\" ][ \"cartesian\" ], ) # Now that we have a structure object, we can feed that and all # other data to the from_toolkit() method. This will create a database # object in the Simmate format. Note the data we pass here is based on # the ExampleProviderData we defined in the other file. structure_db = ExampleProviderData . from_toolkit ( id = entry [ \"my_id\" ], structure = structure , # required by Structure mix-in energy = entry [ \"my_final_energy\" ], # required by Thermodynamics mix-in custom_column_01 = entry [ \"my_custom_column_01\" ], # The get method is useful if not all entries have a given field. custom_column_02 = entry . get ( \"my_custom_column_02\" ), ) # and save it to our database! structure_db . save () Try running this on your dataset (or a subset of data if you want to quickly test things). When it finishes, you can ensure data was loaded properly by running: # in python from simmate.database import connect from simmate.third_parties import ExampleProviderData # Check that the number of rows matches your source data. total_entries = ExampleProviderData . objects . count () # View the data! # The [:100] limits this to your first 100 results my_table = ExampleProviderData . objects . to_dataframe ()[: 100 ] And that's it for writing new code!

If you are trying to pull data from Simmate, then you should instead use our python client that is introduced in the database guides . Grabbing data directly from our REST API is really only for teams that can't use python or Simmate's code but still want to pull data. Also note that grabbing data via our REST API is heavily throttled, so this is not a good way to grab large amounts of data. While the accronym may not be super intuitive for beginners, \"REST API\" stands for \" Re presentational s tate t ransfer (REST) A pplication P rogramming I nterfaces (API)\". In simple terms, this is how we can access databases from a website url. Our example endpoint \u00b6 The easiest way to understand our API is with some examples. In the examples below, we only look at the Materials Project database (at /third-parties/MatprojStructure/ ), but in addition to this example, nearly every URL within Simmate has REST API functionality! Our API endpoints are automatically built from our database module -- so it's very easy to implement new features and add new tables. Accessing the API \u00b6 Let's start with a normal URL and webpage: http://simmate.org/third-parties/MatprojStructure/ When you open that link, you are brought to a webpage that let's you search through all Materials Project structures. Under the hood, this URL is actually a REST API too! All we have to do is add ?format=api to the end of the URL. Try opening this webpage: http://simmate.org/third-parties/MatprojStructure/?format=api Likewise, if we use ?format=json , we can get our data back as a JSON dictionary: http://simmate.org/third-parties/MatprojStructure/?format=json The same can be done for individual entries too! For example, if we wanted all the data for the structure with id mp-1 , then we can do... http://simmate.org/third-parties/MatprojStructure/mp-1/?format=api http://simmate.org/third-parties/MatprojStructure/mp-1/?format=json For these, you should see an output similar too... { \"id\" : \"mp-1\" , \"structure_string\" : \"...(truncated for clarity)\" , \"nsites\" : 1 , \"nelements\" : 1 , \"elements\" : [ \"Cs\" ], \"chemical_system\" : \"Cs\" , \"density\" : 1.9350390306525629 , \"density_atomic\" : 0.00876794537479071 , \"volume\" : 114.05180544066401 , \"volume_molar\" : 68.68360262958124 , \"formula_full\" : \"Cs1\" , \"formula_reduced\" : \"Cs\" , \"formula_anonymous\" : \"A\" , \"energy\" : -0.85663276 , \"energy_per_atom\" : -0.85663276 , \"energy_above_hull\" : null , \"is_stable\" : null , \"decomposes_to\" : null , \"formation_energy\" : null , \"formation_energy_per_atom\" : null , \"spacegroup\" : 229 , } This is super useful because we can grab data from any programming language we'd like -- python, javascript, c++, fortran, or even the command-line. The only requirement to use our REST API is that you have access to the internet! Once you load your desired data, what you do with the JSON output is up to you. Filtering results \u00b6 Our URLs also support complex filtering too. As an example, let's make a search where we want all structures that have the spacegroup 229 and also are in the Cr-N chemcial system. When you make this search in the normal webpage, you'll notice the URL becomes... http://simmate.org/third-parties/MatprojStructure/?chemical_system=Cr-N&spacegroup__number=229 We specify our conditions by adding a question mark ( ? ) at the end of the URL and then adding example_key=desired_value after that. As we add new conditions, we separate them with & -- which results in key1=value1&key2=value2&key3=value3 and so on. You can also add format=api at the end of this too! Note, our python client for accessing data is MUCH more powerful for filtering through results, so we recommend accessing data using the simmate.database module in complex/advanced cases. Paginating results \u00b6 To protect our servers from overuse, Simmate currently returns a maximum of 12 results at a time. Pagination is handled automitically using the page=... keyword in the URL. In the HTML, API, and JSON views, you should always have the link to the next page of results available. For example in the JSON view, the returned data includes next and previous URLs. Ordering results \u00b6 For API and JSON formats, you can manually set the ordering of returned data by adding ordering=example_column to your URL. You can also reverse the ordering with ordering=-example_column (note the \" - \" symbol before the column name). For example: http://simmate.org/third-parties/MatprojStructure/?ordering=density_atomic The API for experts \u00b6 We build Simmate's REST API using the django-rest-framework python package, and implement filtering using django-filter . Our endpoints are NOT fixed but are instead dynamically created for each request. This is thanks to our SimmateAPIViewset class in the simmate.website.core_components module, which takes a Simmate database table and automatically renders an API endpoint for us. The backend implementation of dynamic APIs is still experimental because we are exploring the pros and cons the approach -- for example, this enables quick start-up times for configuring Django, but also comes at the cost of more CPU time per web request.","title":"REST API"},{"location":"full_guides/website/rest_api/#the-rest-api","text":"Warning This section is only for experts!

While the accronym may not be super intuitive for beginners, \"REST API\" stands for \" Re presentational s tate t ransfer (REST) A pplication P rogramming I nterfaces (API)\". In simple terms, this is how we can access databases from a website url.","title":"The REST API"},{"location":"full_guides/website/rest_api/#our-example-endpoint","text":"The easiest way to understand our API is with some examples. In the examples below, we only look at the Materials Project database (at /third-parties/MatprojStructure/ ), but in addition to this example, nearly every URL within Simmate has REST API functionality! Our API endpoints are automatically built from our database module -- so it's very easy to implement new features and add new tables.","title":"Our example endpoint"},{"location":"full_guides/website/rest_api/#accessing-the-api","text":"Let's start with a normal URL and webpage: http://simmate.org/third-parties/MatprojStructure/ When you open that link, you are brought to a webpage that let's you search through all Materials Project structures. Under the hood, this URL is actually a REST API too! All we have to do is add ?format=api to the end of the URL. Try opening this webpage: http://simmate.org/third-parties/MatprojStructure/?format=api Likewise, if we use ?format=json , we can get our data back as a JSON dictionary: http://simmate.org/third-parties/MatprojStructure/?format=json The same can be done for individual entries too! For example, if we wanted all the data for the structure with id mp-1 , then we can do... http://simmate.org/third-parties/MatprojStructure/mp-1/?format=api http://simmate.org/third-parties/MatprojStructure/mp-1/?format=json For these, you should see an output similar too... { \"id\" : \"mp-1\" , \"structure_string\" : \"...(truncated for clarity)\" , \"nsites\" : 1 , \"nelements\" : 1 , \"elements\" : [ \"Cs\" ], \"chemical_system\" : \"Cs\" , \"density\" : 1.9350390306525629 , \"density_atomic\" : 0.00876794537479071 , \"volume\" : 114.05180544066401 , \"volume_molar\" : 68.68360262958124 , \"formula_full\" : \"Cs1\" , \"formula_reduced\" : \"Cs\" , \"formula_anonymous\" : \"A\" , \"energy\" : -0.85663276 , \"energy_per_atom\" : -0.85663276 , \"energy_above_hull\" : null , \"is_stable\" : null , \"decomposes_to\" : null , \"formation_energy\" : null , \"formation_energy_per_atom\" : null , \"spacegroup\" : 229 , } This is super useful because we can grab data from any programming language we'd like -- python, javascript, c++, fortran, or even the command-line.

When you make this search in the normal webpage, you'll notice the URL becomes... http://simmate.org/third-parties/MatprojStructure/?chemical_system=Cr-N&spacegroup__number=229 We specify our conditions by adding a question mark ( ? ) at the end of the URL and then adding example_key=desired_value after that. As we add new conditions, we separate them with & -- which results in key1=value1&key2=value2&key3=value3 and so on. You can also add format=api at the end of this too!

If you skip this step, your workflows will fail and cause errors elsewhere. Tip make sure you have read of \"Workflow Names\" documentation. A basic workflow \u00b6 To build a Simmate workflow, you can have ANY python code you'd like. The only requirement is that you place that code inside a run_config method of a new subclass for Workflow : from simmate.workflow_engine import Workflow class Example__Python__MyFavoriteSettings ( Workflow ): use_database = False # we don't have a database table yet @staticmethod def run_config ( ** kwargs ): print ( \"This workflow doesn't do much\" ) return 42 Note Behind the scenes, the run method is converting our run_config to a workflow and doing extra setup tasks for us. Danger Note that we added **kwargs to our function input. This is required for your workflow to run. Make sure you read the \"Default parameters\" section below to understand why. A pythonic workflow \u00b6 Now let's look at a realistic example where we build a Workflow that has input parameters and accesses class attributes/methods: class Example__Python__MyFavoriteSettings ( Workflow ): use_database = False # we don't have a database table yet example_constant = 12 @staticmethod def squared ( x ): return x ** 2 @classmethod def run_config ( cls , name , say_hello = True , ** kwargs ): # Workflows can contain ANY python code! # In other words... # \"The ceiling is the roof\" -Michael Jordan if say_hello : print ( f \"Hello and welcome, { name } !\" ) # grab class values and methods x = cls . example_constant example_calc = cls . squared ( x ) print ( f \"Our calculation gave a result of { example_calc } \" ) # grab extra arguments if you need them for key , value in kwargs . items (): print ( f \"An extra parameter for { key } was given \" \"with a value of {value} \" ) return \"Success!\" Danger The **kwargs is still important here. Make sure we are adding it at the end of our input parameters. (see the next section for why) Default parameters and using kwargs \u00b6 You'll notice in the workflows above that we used **kwargs in each of our run_config methods, and if you remove these, the workflow will fail. This is because simmate automatically passes default parameters to the run_config method -- even if you didn't define them as inputs. We do this to allow all workflows to access key information about the run. These parameters are: run_id : a unique id to help with tracking a calculation directory : a unique foldername that the calculation will take place in compress_output : whether to compress the directory to a zip file when we're done source : where the input of this calculation came from You can use any of these inputs to help with your workflow. Or alternatively, just add **kwargs to your function and ignore them. Common input parameters \u00b6 You often will use input parameters that correspond to toolkit objects, such as Structure or Composition . If you use the matching input parameter name, these will inherit all of their features -- such as loading from filename, a dictionary, or python object. For example, if you use a structure input variable, it behaves as described in the Parameters section. from simmate.toolkit import Structure from simmate.workflow_engine import Workflow class Example__Python__MyFavoriteSettings ( Workflow ): use_database = False # we don't have a database table yet @staticmethod def run_config ( structure , ** kwargs ): # Even if we give a filename as an input, Simmate will convert it # to a python object for us assert type ( structure ) == Structure # and you can interact with the structure object as usual return structure . volume Tip if you see a parameter in our documentation that has similar use to yours, make sure you use the same name. It can help with adding extra functionality. Writing output files \u00b6 Of all the default parameters (described above), you'll most like get the most from using the directory input. It is important to note that directory is given as a pathlib.Path object. Just add directory to your run_config() method and then use the object that's provided. For example, this workflow will write an output file to simmate-task-12345/my_output.txt (where the simmate-task-12345 folder is automatically set up by Simmate). from simmate.workflow_engine import Workflow class Example__Python__MyFavoriteSettings ( Workflow ): use_database = False # we don't have a database table yet @staticmethod def run_config ( directory , ** kwargs ): # We use the unique directory to write outputs! # Recall that we have a pathlib.Path object. output_file = directory / \"my_output.txt\" with output_file . open ( \"w\" ) as file : file . write ( \"Writing my output!\" ) # If you don't like/know pathlib.Path, you can # convert the directory name back to a string output_filename = str ( output_file ) return \"Done!\" Building from existing workflows \u00b6 For many calculators, there are workflow classes that you can use as a starting point. For example, VASP users can inherit from the VaspWorkflow class, which includes many features built-in: basic VASP example full-feature VASP example Custom INCAR modifier from simmate.calculators.vasp.workflows.base import VaspWorkflow class Relaxation__Vasp__MyExample1 ( VaspWorkflow ): functional = \"PBE\" potcar_mappings = { \"Y\" : \"Y_sv\" , \"C\" : \"C\" } incar = dict ( PREC = \"Normal\" , EDIFF = 1e-4 , ENCUT = 450 , NSW = 100 , KSPACING = 0.4 , ) from simmate.calculators.vasp.workflows.base import VaspWorkflow from simmate.calculators.vasp.inputs.potcar_mappings import ( PBE_ELEMENT_MAPPINGS , ) from simmate.calculators.vasp.error_handlers import ( Frozen , NonConverging , Unconverged , Walltime , ) class Relaxation__Vasp__MyExample2 ( VaspWorkflow ): functional = \"PBE\" potcar_mappings = PBE_ELEMENT_MAPPINGS # (1) incar = dict ( PREC = \"Normal\" , # (2) EDIFF__per_atom = 1e-5 , # (3) ENCUT = 450 , ISIF = 3 , NSW = 100 , IBRION = 1 , POTIM = 0.02 , LCHARG = False , LWAVE = False , KSPACING = 0.4 , multiple_keywords__smart_ismear = { # (4) \"metal\" : dict ( ISMEAR = 1 , SIGMA = 0.06 , ), \"non-metal\" : dict ( ISMEAR = 0 , SIGMA = 0.05 , ), }, # WARNING --> see \"Custom Modifier\"\" tab for this to work EXAMPLE__multiply_nsites = 8 , # (5) ) error_handlers = [ # (6) Unconverged (), NonConverging (), Frozen (), Walltime (), ] You can use pre-set mapping for all elements rather than define them yourself Settings that match the normal VASP input are the same for all structures regardless of composition. Settings can also be set based on the input structure using built-in tags like __per_atom . Note the two underscores ( __ ) signals that we are using a input modifier. The type of smearing we use depends on if we have a metal, semiconductor, or insulator. So we need to decide this using a built-in keyword modifier named smart_ismear . Because this handles the setting of multiple INCAR values, the input begins with multiple_keywords instead of a parameter name. If you want to create your own logic for an input parameter, you can do that as well. Here we are showing a new modifier named multiply_nsites . This would set the incar value of EXAMPLE=16 for structure with 2 sites (2*8=16). Note, we define how this modifer works and register it in the \"Custom INCAR modifier\" tab. Make sure you include this code as well. These are some default error handlers to use, and there are many more error handlers available than what's shown. Note, the order of the handlers matters here. Only the first error handler triggered in this list will be used before restarting the job If you need to add advanced logic for one of your INCAR tags, you can register a keyword_modifier to the INCAR class like so: # STEP 1: define the logic of your modifier as a function # Note that the function name must begin with \"keyword_modifier_\" def keyword_modifier_multiply_nsites ( structure , example_mod_input ): # add your advanced logic to determine the keyword value. return structure . num_sites * example_mod_input # STEP 2: register modifier with the Incar class from simmate.calculators.vasp.inputs import Incar Incar . add_keyword_modifier ( keyword_modifier_multiply_nsites ) # STEP 3: use your new modifier with any parameter you'd like incar = dict ( \"NSW__multiply_nsites\" : 2 , \"EXAMPLE__multiply_nsites\" : 123 , ) Danger Make sure this code is ran BEFORE you run the workflow. Registration is reset every time a new python session starts. Therefore, we recommend keeping your modifer in the same file that you define your workflow in. Further, can use python inheritance to borrow utilities and settings from an existing workflow: from simmate.workflows.utilities import get_workflow original_workflow = get_workflow ( \"static-energy.vasp.matproj\" ) class StaticEnergy__Vasp__MyCustomPreset ( original_workflow ): version = \"2022.07.04\" incar = original_workflow . incar . copy () # Make sure you copy! incar . update ( dict ( NPAR = 1 , ENCUT =- 1 , ) ) # make sure we have new settings updated # and that we didn't change the original assert original_workflow . incar != StaticEnergy__Vasp__MyCustomPreset Danger Make sure you are making copies of the original workflow settings! If you modify them without making a copy, you'll actually be changing the original workflow settings. The assert check that we make in the example above is therefore very important. Tip To gain more insight to workflows like this, you should read through both the \"Creating S3 Workflows\" and \"Third-party Software\" sections for more information. Linking a database table \u00b6 Many of workflows will want to store common types of data (such as static energy or relaxation data). If you would like to use these tables automatically, you simply to make sure you name_type matches what is available! For example, if we look at a static-energy calculation, you will see the StaticEnergy database table is automatically used because the name of our workflow starts with \"StaticEnergy\": from simmate.database import connect from simmate.database.workflow_results import StaticEnergy # no work required! This line shows everything is setup and working assert StaticEnergy__Vasp__MyCustomPreset . database_table == StaticEnergy If you would like to build or use a custom database, you must first have a registered DatabaseTable , and then you can link the database table to your workflow directly. The only other requiredment is that your database table uses the Calculation database mix-in: from my_project.models import MyCustomTable class Example__Python__MyFavoriteSettings ( Workflow ): database_table = MyCustomTable Tip See the \"Getting Started\" and \"Database\" tutorials for how to build a custom database table. Warning Make sure your table uses the Calculation mix-in so that the run information can be stored properly Workflows that call a command \u00b6 In many cases, you may have a workflow that runs a command or some external program and then reads the results from output files. An example of this would be an energy calculation using VASP. If your workflow involves calling another program, you should read about the S3Workflow which helps with writing input files, calling other programs, and handling errors. Registering your workflow \u00b6 Registering your workflow so that you can access it in the UI requires you to build a \"simmate project\". This is covered in the getting-started tutorials. Note For now, you can treat this step as optional if you do not have any custom database tables. Running our custom workflow \u00b6 Once you have your new workflow and registered it, you can run it as you would any other one. yaml python workflow_name : path/to/my/script.py:my_workflow_obj # (1) # Example parameters from our \"Basic Workflow\" above name : Jack say_hello : true If your workflow is not regiestered, you need to provide the path to your python script (e.g. my_script.py file) and then the variable name that the workflow is stored as. The normal variable would be Example__Python__MyFavoriteSettings , but in the python example, we set it to something shorter like my_workflow for convenience. # in the same file the workflow is defined in # These names can be long and unfriendly, so it can be nice to # link them to a variable name for easier access. my_workflow = Example__Python__MyFavoriteSettings # Here we use parameters from our \"Basic Workflow\" above state = my_workflow . run ( name = \"Jack\" say_hello = True , ) result = state . result () Example If you wrote your workflow in a file name learning_simmate.py , you could set the workflow_name to learning_simmate.py:Example__Python__MyFavoriteSettings . Make sure you read the \"common input parameters\" section above. These let us really take advantage of how we provide our input. For example, a structure parameter will automatically accept filenames or database entries: yaml python workflow_name : path/to/my/script.py:my_workflow_obj # Automatic features! structure : database_table : MatProjStructure database_id : mp-123 # in the same file the workflow is defined in state = my_workflow . run ( structure = { \"database_table\" : \"MatProjStructure\" , \"database_id\" : \"mp-123\" , } ) result = state . result () Warning When switching from Python to YAML, make sure you adjust the input format of your parameters. This is especially important if you use python a list or dict for one of your input parameters. Further, if you have complex input parameters (e.g. nested lists, matricies, etc.), we recommend using a TOML input file instead. lists dictionaries nested lists tuple # in python my_parameter = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] # in yaml my_parameter : - 1 - 2 - 3 # in python my_parameter = { \"a\" : 123 , \"b\" : 456 , \"c\" : [ \"apple\" , \"orange\" , \"grape\" ]} # in yaml my_parameter : a : 123 b : 456 c : - apple - orange - grape # in toml [my_parameter] a = 123 b = 456 c = [ \"apple\" , \"orange\" , \"grape\" ] # in python my_parameter = [ [ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 , 9 ], ] # in yaml (we recommend switching to TOML!) my_parameter : - - 1 - 2 - 3 - - 4 - 5 - 6 - - 7 - 8 - 9 # in toml my_parameter = [ [ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 , 9 ], ] # in python my_parameter = ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) # in yaml my_parameter : - 1 - 2 - 3 # WARNING: This will return a list! Make sure you call # `tuple(my_parameter)` # at the start of your workflow's `run_config` if you need a tuple. # in toml my_parameter = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] # WARNING: This will return a list! Make sure you call # `tuple(my_parameter)` # at the start of your workflow's `run_config` if you need a tuple. Creating nested workflows \u00b6 Because workflows can contain any python code, they can also make calls to other workflows -- either via run or run_cloud methods When using run , you often want workflows to share a working directory, so that you can find the results all in one place. from simmate.workflows.utilities import get_workflow from simmate.workflow_engine import Workflow class Example__Python__MyFavoriteSettings ( Workflow ): use_database = False # we don't have a database table yet @staticmethod def run_config ( structure , directory , ** kwargs ): # you can grab a workflow locally, attach one as a class # attribute, or anything else possible with python another_workflow = get_workflow ( \"static-energy.vasp.mit\" ) # And run the workflow how you would like. Here, we are # just running the workflow 10 times in row on different # perturbations or \"rattling\" of the original structure for n in range ( 10 ): another_workflow . run ( structure = structure . perturb ( 0.05 ) directory = directory / f \"perturb_number_ { n } \" , # **kwargs, <-- you may want to pass kwargs too. ) return 42 Warning when using run_cloud you should NOT share a working directory. This causes problems when you have computational resource scattered accross different computers & file systems.

Only the first error handler triggered in this list will be used before restarting the job If you need to add advanced logic for one of your INCAR tags, you can register a keyword_modifier to the INCAR class like so: # STEP 1: define the logic of your modifier as a function # Note that the function name must begin with \"keyword_modifier_\" def keyword_modifier_multiply_nsites ( structure , example_mod_input ): # add your advanced logic to determine the keyword value. return structure . num_sites * example_mod_input # STEP 2: register modifier with the Incar class from simmate.calculators.vasp.inputs import Incar Incar . add_keyword_modifier ( keyword_modifier_multiply_nsites ) # STEP 3: use your new modifier with any parameter you'd like incar = dict ( \"NSW__multiply_nsites\" : 2 , \"EXAMPLE__multiply_nsites\" : 123 , ) Danger Make sure this code is ran BEFORE you run the workflow. Registration is reset every time a new python session starts. Therefore, we recommend keeping your modifer in the same file that you define your workflow in. Further, can use python inheritance to borrow utilities and settings from an existing workflow: from simmate.workflows.utilities import get_workflow original_workflow = get_workflow ( \"static-energy.vasp.matproj\" ) class StaticEnergy__Vasp__MyCustomPreset ( original_workflow ): version = \"2022.07.04\" incar = original_workflow . incar . copy () # Make sure you copy! incar . update ( dict ( NPAR = 1 , ENCUT =- 1 , ) ) # make sure we have new settings updated # and that we didn't change the original assert original_workflow . incar != StaticEnergy__Vasp__MyCustomPreset Danger Make sure you are making copies of the original workflow settings! If you modify them without making a copy, you'll actually be changing the original workflow settings. The assert check that we make in the example above is therefore very important.

If you'd like to avoid importing this way, you can instead use the get_workflow utility: from simmate.workflows.utilities import get_workflow workflow = get_workflow ( \"static-energy.vasp.matproj\" ) The Simmate Workflow Engine \u00b6 This module defines common workflows, error handling, and submission/running of workflows. It is ment for users that want to create custom workflows from scratch. Use of this module is closely tied with Tutorials 06 and 09 . This module is only meant for advanced users. Beginners should instead start by checking if there is already a workflow built for them (in simmate.workflows ) or by checking if there are common base workflows already built for the program they are using in simmate.calculators . For example, VASP users can check simmate.calculators.vasp.workflows . Overview of classes \u00b6 Here we try to give a birds-eye view of Simmate workflows and a commonly used subclass known as a \"s3 workflow\". This section is not meant to be an encompassing guide. Instead, beginners should refer to our tutorials and class-level API docs. What is a Workflow ? \u00b6 Recall from Simmate's tutorial 02 , that a Workflow is made up of 4 stages: configure : chooses our desired settings for the calculation (such as VASP's INCAR settings) schedule : decides whether to run the workflow immediately or send off to a job queue (e.g. SLURM, PBS, or remote computers) execute : writes our input files, runs the calculation (e.g. VASP), and checks the results for errors save : saves the results to our database The configure step is simply how a workflow is defined. Pre-built workflows do this for you already, but you may want to create a custom workflow for more. By creating a new Workflow subclass, you've configured it. The schedule step is handled entirely by Simmate. All that you need to know is that run will carry out the workflow on your local computer, while run_cloud will schedule the workflow to run remotely. The execute step is what we typically think of when we think \"workflow\". It can be anything and everything. The example given (writing inputs, calling a program, and reading output files) is the most common type of workflow in Simmate -- known as a \"S3Workflow\". This is explained more below. The save step is simply taking the result of the execute and saving it to a SQL database. This is handled automatically for common workflows types like relaxations, dynamics, or static-energy calculations, but advanced users may want to customize their own methods. All stages of a Workflow are done through the run or run_cloud methods. That is... Workflow.run = configure + schedule + execute + save . To begin building custom workflows, make sure you have completed tutorial 06 and then read through the simmate.workflow_engine.workflow documentation. What is a NestedWorkflow ? \u00b6 Some workflows are \"nested\", which means it's a workflow made up multiple other workflows. An example of this is the relaxation.vasp.staged workflow, which involves a series of relaxations of increasing quality and then a final energy calculation. What is an S3Workflow ? \u00b6 Many workflows involve writing input files, calling some external program, and then reading through the output files. All workflows like this are known as \" S3Workflow \"s. S3 means the workflow is Supervised , Staged , and a Shell call. For shorthand, we call this a \"S3\" workflow. There is some history behind why it's named this way, but here is how the name breaks down: Staged : the overall calculation is made of three stages (each is a class method) setup = write input files run_command_and_monitor = the actual running & monitoring of the program workup = reading the output files Shell : the calculator is called through the command-line (the actual execution call) Supervised : once the shell command is started, Simmate runs in the background to monitor it for errors (occurs during the execution call) All stages of this S3 workflow are packed into the excute step of a Workflow , where Simmate has a lot of functionality built for you already.

Let's breakdown what this means... A shell command is a single call to some external program. For example, VASP requires that we call the \"vasp_std > vasp.out\" command in order to run a calculation. We consider calling external programs a staged task made up of three steps: setup = writing any input files required for the program execute = actually calling the command and running our program workup = loading data from output files back into python And for supervising the task, this means we monitor the program while the execution stage is running. So once a program is started, Simmate can check output files for common errors/issues -- even while the other program is still running. If an error is found, we stop the program, fix the issue, and then restart it. graph LR A[Start] --> B[setup]; B --> C[execute]; C --> D[workup]; D --> E[Has errors?]; E -->|Yes| B; E -->|No| F[Done!]; Warning This diagram is slightly misleading because the \"Has Errors?\" check also happens while the execute step is still running .

S3Workflows for common Calculators \u00b6 For programs that are commonly used in material science, you should also read through their guides in the \"Third-party Software\" section. If your program is listed there, then there is likely a subclass of S3Workflow already built for you. For example, VASP user can take advantage of VaspWorkflow to build workflows. Building a custom S3Workflow \u00b6 Tip Before starting a custom S3Workflow , make sure you have read the section above this (on S3Workflows for common Calculators like VASP). You should also have gone through the guides on building a custom Workflow . Simple command call \u00b6 The most basic example of a S3Workflow is just calling some command -- without doing anything else (no input files, no error handling, etc.). Unlike custom Workflows were we defined a run_config method, S3Workflows have a pre-built run_config method that carries out the different stages and monitoring of a workflow for us. So all the work is already done for us! As an example, let's just use the command echo to print something: from simmate.workflow_engine import S3Workflow class Example__Echo__SayHello ( S3Workflow ): use_database = False # we aren't using a custom table for now monitor = False # there is no error handling yet command = \"echo Hello\" # behaves like a normal workflow state = Example__Echo__SayHello . run () result = state . result () IMPORTANT: Note that we used \"Echo\" in our workflow name. This helps the user see what commands or programs will be called when a workflow is ran. Custom setup and workup \u00b6 Now what if we'd like to write input files or read output files that are created? Here, we need to update our setup and workup methods: from simmate.workflow_engine import S3Workflow class Example__Echo__SayHello ( S3Workflow ): use_database = False # we aren't using a custom table for now monitor = False # there is no error handling yet command = \"echo Hello > output.txt\" # adds \"Hello\" into a new file @classmethod def setup ( cls , directory , custom_parameter , ** kwargs ): # The directory given is a pathlib.Path object for the directory # that the command will be called in print ( \"I'm setting things up!\" ) print ( f \"My new setting value is { cls . some_new_setting } \" ) print ( f \"My new parameter value is { custom_parmeter } \" ) return # no need to return anything. Nothing will be done with it. @staticmethod def workup ( directory ): # The directory given is a pathlib.Path object for the directory # that the command will be called in # Simply check that we have a new file output_file = directory / \"output.txt\" assert output_file . exists () print ( \"I'm working things up!\" ) return \"Done!\" task = Example__Echo__SayHello () result = task . run () There are a two important things to note here: It's optional to write new setup or workup methods. But if you do... Both setup and workup method should be either a staticmethod or classmethod Custom setup methods require the directory and **kwargs input parameters. Custom workup methods require the directory input paramter It's optional to set/overwrite attributes. You can also add new ones too. Note: S3Workflows for a custom calculator (such VaspWorkflow for VASP) will often have custom setup and workup methods already defined for you. You can update/override these as you see fit.

As a quick example: command line python # in example.yaml workflow_name : static-energy.vasp.matproj structure : NaCl.cif command : mpirun -n 4 vasp_std > vasp.out simmate workflows run example.yaml from simmate.workflows.utilities import get_workflow workflow = get_workflow ( \"static-energy.vasp.matproj\" ) state = workflow . run ( structure = \"NaCl.cif\" , command = \"mpirun -n 4 vasp_std > vasp.out\" , ) Running a workflow (cloud) \u00b6 When you want to schedule a workflow to run elsewhere, you must first make sure you have your computational resources configured. You can then run workflows using the run_cloud method: command line python # in example.yaml workflow_name : static-energy.vasp.matproj structure : NaCl.cif command : mpirun -n 4 vasp_std > vasp.out simmate workflows run-cloud example.yaml from simmate.workflows.utilities import get_workflow workflow = get_workflow ( \"static-energy.vasp.matproj\" ) state = workflow . run ( structure = \"NaCl.cif\" , command = \"mpirun -n 4 vasp_std > vasp.out\" , ) Warning The run-cloud command/method only schedules the workflow. It won't run until you add computational resources (or Workers ). To do this, you must read through the \"Adding computational resources\" section. Accessing results \u00b6 There are several ways to view the results of a workflow run, and some approaches are better than others. Tip If you'd like to run many workflows and get the results in an excel spreedsheet, then go with option 3! Option 1: output files \u00b6 Simply go to the directory that the calculation ran in, and you may notice a few extra files in your output. One of them is simmate_summary.yaml , which contains some quick information for you. Simmate can also catch errors, correct them, and retry a calculation. If this occurred during your workflow run, you'll see a file named simmate_corrections.csv with all the errors that were incountered and how they were fixed. Other workflows will also write out plots for you. For example, electronic-structure workflows will calculate a band structure using Materials Project settings, and write an image of your final band structure to band_structure.png . These extra files and plots vary for each workflow, but they make checking your results nice and quick. Tip While the plots and summary files are nice for quick viewing, there is much more information available in the database. Furthermore, you can also use python toolkit objects to run a custom analysis. These are covered in the next two sections. Option 2: toolkit objects \u00b6 When running a workflow in python, a State object is returned. From this, you can access the results as toolkit objects. States allows you to check if the run completed successfully or not. Then final output of your workflow run can be accessed using state.result() . The State is based off of Prefect's state object, which you can read more about here . We use State s because the status of a run becomes important when we start scheduling runs to run remotely, and more importantly, it allows use to building in compatibility with other workflow engines like Prefect. python (local) python (cloud) state = workflow . run ( ... ) result = state . result () state = workflow . run_cloud ( ... ) # This will block and wait for the job to finish result = state . result () Tip This approach is best for users comfortable with python. If you want to use these features, we recommend reading through the Toolkit guides. Option 3: the database \u00b6 You can also view results database through the database_table attribute (if one is available). This returns a Simmate database object for results of ALL runs of this workflow. But as an example: python table = workflow . database_table # pandas dataframe that you can view in Spyder df = table . objects . to_dataframe () # or grab a specific run result and convert to a toolkit object entry = table . objects . get ( run_id = \"example-123456\" ) structure = entry . to_toolkit () You'll notice the table gives results for all runs of this type (e.g. all static-energies). To limit your results to just this specific workflow, you can use the all_results property: python results = workflow . all_results # the line above is a shortcut for... table = workflow . database_table results = table . objects . filter ( workflow_name = workflow . name_full ) Tip Guides for filtering and manulipating the data in this table is covered in the Database guides.","title":"Using existing workflows"},{"location":"full_guides/workflows/using_existing_workflows/#using-existing-workflows","text":"","title":"Using existing workflows"},{"location":"full_guides/workflows/using_existing_workflows/#exploring-available-workflows","text":"command line python simmate workflows list-all # gives all workflows simmate workflows explore # let's you inspect workflows # in example.yaml workflow_name : static-energy.vasp.matproj from simmate.workflows.utilities import get_workflow workflow = get_workflow ( \"static-energy.vasp.matproj\" ) Tip Read through the \"Workflow Names\" section for a better understanding of the different workflows available.","title":"Exploring available workflows"},{"location":"full_guides/workflows/using_existing_workflows/#viewing-parameters-options","text":"Because parameters are super important for using Simmate, we gave them their own section in our documentation.

To guarantee compatibility, we need to build all vasp dependencies by hand (for example, Ubuntu uses gcc v11 but vasp requires v9). For the Warren Lab, we have packaged everything in one zip file to make setup as simple as possible. Copy /media/synology/software/vasp/vasp.zip from WarWulf to your computer, such as your home directory (e.g. /home/jacksund/ ). This file is only 172.1MB, but will be over 9GB once we are finished installing vasp. Within the vasp directory, there are folders from (1) to (9) for each build step.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to run workflows on distributed computational resources -- with full scheduling and monitoring. The quick tutorial The full tutorial A review of concepts Should I set up my own cluster? Setting up your scheduler with Prefect Setting up your cluster with Dask Connecting others to your scheduler For beginners, this will be the most difficult part of setting up Simmate -- but it is entirely optional. Be sure to read the section on Should I set up my own cluster? . There are many ways to set up your resources and caviats to each (especially if you are using university or federal supercomputers). While python experts should be able to learn Prefect and Dask quickly, we strongly urge beginners to get advice from our team. If you struggle to follow along with this tutorial, post a question or email us directly (simmate.team@gmail.com). The quick tutorial \u00b6 prefect , dask , and dask_jobqueue will be already installed for you because they are dependencies of Simmate Be aware that you can share a cloud database without sharing computational resources. This flexibility is very important for many collaborations. Just like with your cloud database, designate a point-person to manage your private computational resources. Everyone else can skip to step 9. Either sign in to Prefect Cloud (recommended) or setup a Prefect Server . Connect to your server with the following steps (this is from Prefect's tutorial ): On Prefect Cloud's homepage, go to User -> Account Settings -> API Keys -> Create An API Key Copy the created key set your Prefect backend with the command prefect backend cloud tell Prefect your key with the command prefect auth login --key example_key_h123j2jfk Register all Simmate workflows with Prefect using the command simmate workflow-engine setup-cloud Test that Prefect is configured properly with the following steps (this will run the workflow locally): run the command prefect agent local start (note that this will run endlessly and submit all workflows in parallel. use crtl+C to stop) in a separate terminal, rerun our workflow from tutorial 2 with run-cloud instead of run (so simmate workflows run-cloud relaxation_mit POSCAR ) Set up your computational resources using Dask (and if needed, Dask JobQueue). There are MANY options for this, which are covered in the simmate.workflow_engine module. Take the time to read the documentation here. But as an example, we'll set up a SLURM cluster and then link it to a Prefect agent. Note, if you want to run workflows with commands like mpirun -n 18 vasp_std > vasp.out , then limit the Dask worker to one core while having the SLURM job request more cores. The resulting python script will look something like this: # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- # STEP 1: Configure our Dask Cluster. from dask_jobqueue import SLURMCluster cluster = SLURMCluster ( # # General options scheduler_options = { \"port\" : 8786 }, local_directory = \"~\" , # # # Dask Worker Options cores = 1 , processes = 1 , memory = \"4GB\" , # REQUIRED: Make sure you preload this script! extra = [ \"--preload simmate.configuration.dask.connect_to_database\" ], # # # SLURM Job Options job_cpu = 18 , job_mem = \"50GB\" , job_extra = [ \"--output=slurm-%j.out\" , \"-N 1\" , ], walltime = \"300-00:00:00\" , queue = \"p1\" , # this is the name of the SLURM queue/partition env_extra = [ \"module load vasp;\" ], # our workflow requires the vasp module to be loaded ) # Scale the cluster to the number of SLURM jobs that you'd like cluster . scale ( 10 ) # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- # STEP 2: Configure our Prefect Agent and start submitting workflows! from prefect.agent.local import LocalAgent from simmate.configuration.prefect.connect_to_dask import set_default_executor # We want Prefect to use our Dask Cluster to run all of the workflow tasks. To # tell Prefect to do this, we wrote a helper function that ships with Simmate. set_default_executor ( cluster . scheduler . address ) # Start our cluster! Our cluster's name is Warwulf, so we use that here. agent = LocalAgent ( name = \"WarWulf\" , labels = [ \"WarWulf\" ], ) # Now we can start the Prefect Agent which will run and search for jobs and then # submit them to our Dask cluster. agent . start () # NOTE: this line will run endlessly unless you set a timelimit in the LocalAgent above # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Test out your cluster by running simmate workflows run-cloud relaxation_mit POSCAR in a separate terminal (submit this a bunch if you'd like to). If you'd like to limit how many workflows of a given tag (e.g. \"WarWulf\" above) run in parallel, set the concurrency limit in Prefect cloud here . To let others use your cluster, simply add them to your Prefect Cloud and give them an API key. They just need to do the following: set your Prefect backend with the command prefect backend cloud tell Prefect your key with the command prefect auth login --key example_key_h123j2jfk try submitting a workflow with simmate workflows run-cloud relaxation_mit POSCAR The full tutorial \u00b6 A review of concepts \u00b6 Recall from tutorial 2, there are 4 steps to a workflow: - configure : chooses our desired settings for the calculation (such as VASP's INCAR settings) - schedule : decides whether to run the workflow immediately or send off to a job queue (e.g. SLURM, PBS, or remote computers) - execute : writes our input files, runs the calculation (e.g. calling VASP), and checks the results for errors - save : saves the results to our database This tuturial will give an overview of how to modify the schedule and determine which computer execute is called on. Up until now, we have been using the default behavior for these two steps. But now we want to instead do the following: - schedule : submits the workflow to a scheduler queue of many other workflows - execute : run the calculation on a remote cluster A scheduler is something we submit workflows to and controls when to run them. As a bunch of workflows are submitted, our scheduler forms a queue and keeps track of which ones to run next. We will use Prefect as our scheduler. A cluster is a group of computational resources that actually run the workflows. So our scheduler will find whichever workflow should be ran next, and send it to our cluster to run. Clusters are often made up of \"workers\" -- where a worker is just a single resource and it works through one job at a time. For example, if we had a cluster made up of 10 desktop computers, each computer would run a workflow and once finished ask the scheduler for the next workflow to run. At any given time, 10 workflows will be running. We'll use Dask to set up our cluster, whether your resources are on the cloud, a supercomputer, or just simple desktops. Should I set up my own cluster? \u00b6 Before we start... We understand that resource restrictions can be very stingent between labs and companies. So sharing resources is not possible, even in close collaborations. Simmate addresses this issue by making it easy to share a cloud database without sharing computational resources. In other words, you can contribute to a shared database without letting others see/access your computational resources. With that said, each team will likely need to handle their own computational resources, which can be any number of things: - a university or federal HPC cluster with SLURM, PBS, or some other queue system - a single node or even a Kubernetes cluster provided by a commercial service like DigitalOcean, GoogleCloud, etc. - a series of desktop computers that your lab shares - any combination of these resources The easiest way to use these resources is to sign on and run simmate directly on it. When this is done, the workflow runs directly on your resource and it will run there immediately. We've already see this with Tutorial 2 when we called simmate workflows run ... . Just use that on your new resource to start! (for help signing on to remote supercomputers and installing anaconda, be sure to ask the cluster's IT team). As another example, you can submit a workflow to a SLURM cluster with a submit.sh file like this: #!/bin/bash #SBATCH --output=slurm.out #SBATCH --nodes=1 #SBATCH --ntasks=2 # make sure you have you activated your conda enviornment # and required modules before submitting simmate workflows run-cloud relaxation_mit POSCAR > simmate.out If you are only running a few workflows per day (<10), we recommend you stick to running workflows in this way. That is, just calling simmate workflows run . Don't overcomplicate things. Alternatively, if your team is submitting hundreds or thousands of workflows at a time, then it would be extremely useful to monitor and orchestrate these workflows. To do this, we will use Prefect and Dask. Just like with our cloud database in the previous tutorial, you only need ONE person to manage ALL of your computational resources. Once the resources have been set up, the other users can connect using API key (which is essentially a username+password). Setting up your scheduler with Prefect \u00b6 The first half of this section is just a replica of Prefect's tutorial, but rewritten in a condensed format. If you prefer, you can use their tutorial instead: Introduction to Prefect Orchestration With Prefect as our scheduler, we have two options on how to set this up: Prefect Cloud or Prefect Server. They give a guide on which to choose here , but to summarize: - Prefect Server is free and open-source, but it requires you set up a server and manage it independently - Prefect Cloud is free for your first 20,000 workflow tasks each month (here's their pricing page ) and all set up for you Our team uses Prefect Cloud and recommends that beginners do the same. Unless you are running dozens of [evolutionary searches] per month, you won't come close to the 20,000 workflow task-run limit. This tutorial will continue with Prefect Cloud, but if you decide on Prefect Server , you'll have to set that up before continuing. Go ahead and sign in to Prefect Cloud (use your github account if you have one!). Everything will be empty to start, so we want to add all of Simmate's workflows to our interface here. To do this, we need an API key, which acts like a username and password. It's how we tell python that we now have a Prefect account. To get your API key, go to Prefect Cloud's homepage and navigate to User -> Account Settings -> API Keys -> Create An API Key . Copy the created API key. On your computer, open a terminal and make sure you have your conda enviornment active. Prefect is already installed because the installation of Simmate did it for us. So run the command: prefect backend cloud . This just tells prefect that we decided to use their scheduler. Next, run the command prefect auth login --key example_key_h123j2jfk where you replace the end text with your copied API KEY. We can now use Simmate to access your cloud and submit workflows for us! To get started, we need to add all of our workflows to Prefect. This is done with simmate workflow-engine setup-cloud . After running this, you should see all of the workflow in your Prefect Cloud now! If you were to use the simmate workflows run command that we've been using, you'll notice it still runs directly on your computer. To instead submit it to Prefect Cloud, use the command simmate workflows run-cloud instead. So for an example workflow, the full command would be... simmate workflows run-cloud relaxation_mit POSCAR . When you use run-cloud , the workflow run shows up in your Prefect Cloud, but it's not running. That is because we need a Prefect \"Agent\" -- an Agent simply checks for workflows that need to be ran and submits them to a cluster of computational resources. Let's start a Prefect Agent with all default settings (no cluster is attached yet), which means it will simply run the workflow on whichever computer the agent is on. To do this, run the command prefect agent local start . You'll see it pick up the workflow we submitted with run-cloud and run it. Even after the job completes, the agent will continue to run. So if you submit a new workflow, it will run it as well. We skimmed over a lot of the fundamentals for Prefect here, so we highly recommend going through Prefect's guides and tutorials . Spending a day or two on this will save you a lot of headache down the road. Setting up your cluster with Dask \u00b6 Because there is such a diverse set of computational resources that teams can have, we can't cover all setup scenarios in this tutorial. Instead, we will go through some examples of submitting Simmate workflows to a Dask cluster. This will all be on your local computer. For switching to remote resources (and job queue clusters like SLURM), we can only point you to key tutorials and documentation on how to set up your cluster. You can ask our team which setup is the best fit for your team, and we'll try to guide you through the process. Setting up your cluster shouldn't take longer than a hour, so post a question if you're struggling! Here are some useful resources for setting up a cluster with Dask. We recommend going through these before trying to use Dask with Simmate: - Introduction to Dask Futures - This is the best tutorial to start with! Then go through their example . Dask can do a lot, but Simmate only really uses this feature. If you understand how to use the client.submit , then you understand how Simmate is using Dask - Introduction to Dask Jobqueue - If you use a queue system like PBS, Slurm, MOAB, SGE, LSF, and HTCondor, then this will show you how to set up a cluster on your resource. Here's a simple example of using Dask to run a function that \"sleeps\" for 1 second import time # This loop will take 60 seconds to complete for n in range ( 60 ): # run this 60 times time . sleep ( 1 ) # sleeps 1 second # Now we switch to using Dask from dask.distributed import Client client = Client () # Futures are basically our \"job_id\". They let us check the status and result futures = [] for n in range ( 60 ): # run this 60 times # submits time.sleep(1) to Dask. pure=False tells Dask to rerun each instead # of loading past results from each time.sleep(1). future = client . submit ( time . sleep , 1 , pure = False ) futures . append ( future ) # now wait for all the jobs to finish # This will take much less than 60 seconds! results = [ future . result () for future in futures ] We'll now try using Dask to run our Simmate workflows. In serial (one item at time) \u00b6 Let's start with how we've been submitting workflows: using workflow.run . This runs the workflow immediately and on your local computer. If we were to run a workflow of many structures, only one workflow would run at a time. Once a workflow completes, it moves on to the next one: from simmate.workflows import example_workflow for structure in structures : result = example_workflow . run ( structure = structure ) In parallel (many workflows at once) \u00b6 To use your entire computer and all of its CPUs, we can set up a Dask cluster. There's one added thing you need to do though -- and that's make sure all of Dask workers are able to connect to the Simmate database. This example let's you submit a bunch of workflows and multiple workflows can run at the same time. You can do this with... # first setup Dask so that it can connect to Simmate from dask.distributed import Client client = Client ( preload = \"simmate.configuration.dask.connect_to_database\" ) # now submit your workflows and futures = [] for structure in structures : future = client . submit ( example_workflow . run , structure = structure ) result = future . result () # wait for all workflows to finish # you can monitor progress at http://localhost:8787/status In parallel (many tasks from a single workflow at once) \u00b6 But what if you want to run a single workflow with all of it's tasks in parallel? To do that, we use... # first setup Dask so that it can connect to Simmate from dask.distributed import Client client = Client ( preload = \"simmate.configuration.dask.connect_to_database\" ) # Tell Prefect that we should submit each task to Dask from prefect.executors import DaskExecutor example_workflow . executor = DaskExecutor ( address = client . scheduler . address ) # now run your workflow and wait for it to finish result = example_workflow . run () Connecting your Dask cluster to your Prefect Agent \u00b6 Once you learned how to set up your Dask cluster, the next step is tell Prefect where it is. You can always write your python script as two steps: Configure and then start your Dask Cluster. Configure and then start your Prefect Agent, which will start submitting workflows! In the future, we hope to have more convenient methods through the command-line, but these features are not complete yet. Connecting others to your scheduler \u00b6 Once you've set up your scheduler with Prefect and cluster with Dask, your team members simply need to connect to Prefect Cloud to submit their workflows. Generate an API key for them. Then they can complete step 9 of the quick tutorial (above). Just remember... workflow.run() in python and simmate workflows run in the command-line will still run the workflow locally and right away. workflow.run_cloud() in python and simmate workflows run-cloud in the command-line will submit your workflow to Prefect Cloud.","title":"Integrate with Prefect and Dask"},{"location":"getting_started/_Integrate_with_Prefect_and_Dask/#integrate-with-prefect-and-dask","text":"We do not recommend this tutorial for users at the moment.

The quick tutorial The full tutorial A review of concepts Should I set up my own cluster? Setting up your scheduler with Prefect Setting up your cluster with Dask Connecting others to your scheduler For beginners, this will be the most difficult part of setting up Simmate -- but it is entirely optional. Be sure to read the section on Should I set up my own cluster? . There are many ways to set up your resources and caviats to each (especially if you are using university or federal supercomputers). While python experts should be able to learn Prefect and Dask quickly, we strongly urge beginners to get advice from our team. If you struggle to follow along with this tutorial, post a question or email us directly (simmate.team@gmail.com).","title":"Integrate with Prefect and Dask"},{"location":"getting_started/_Integrate_with_Prefect_and_Dask/#the-quick-tutorial","text":"prefect , dask , and dask_jobqueue will be already installed for you because they are dependencies of Simmate Be aware that you can share a cloud database without sharing computational resources. This flexibility is very important for many collaborations. Just like with your cloud database, designate a point-person to manage your private computational resources. Everyone else can skip to step 9. Either sign in to Prefect Cloud (recommended) or setup a Prefect Server . Connect to your server with the following steps (this is from Prefect's tutorial ): On Prefect Cloud's homepage, go to User -> Account Settings -> API Keys -> Create An API Key Copy the created key set your Prefect backend with the command prefect backend cloud tell Prefect your key with the command prefect auth login --key example_key_h123j2jfk Register all Simmate workflows with Prefect using the command simmate workflow-engine setup-cloud Test that Prefect is configured properly with the following steps (this will run the workflow locally): run the command prefect agent local start (note that this will run endlessly and submit all workflows in parallel. use crtl+C to stop) in a separate terminal, rerun our workflow from tutorial 2 with run-cloud instead of run (so simmate workflows run-cloud relaxation_mit POSCAR ) Set up your computational resources using Dask (and if needed, Dask JobQueue). There are MANY options for this, which are covered in the simmate.workflow_engine module. Take the time to read the documentation here. But as an example, we'll set up a SLURM cluster and then link it to a Prefect agent. Note, if you want to run workflows with commands like mpirun -n 18 vasp_std > vasp.out , then limit the Dask worker to one core while having the SLURM job request more cores. The resulting python script will look something like this: # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- # STEP 1: Configure our Dask Cluster. from dask_jobqueue import SLURMCluster cluster = SLURMCluster ( # # General options scheduler_options = { \"port\" : 8786 }, local_directory = \"~\" , # # # Dask Worker Options cores = 1 , processes = 1 , memory = \"4GB\" , # REQUIRED: Make sure you preload this script! extra = [ \"--preload simmate.configuration.dask.connect_to_database\" ], # # # SLURM Job Options job_cpu = 18 , job_mem = \"50GB\" , job_extra = [ \"--output=slurm-%j.out\" , \"-N 1\" , ], walltime = \"300-00:00:00\" , queue = \"p1\" , # this is the name of the SLURM queue/partition env_extra = [ \"module load vasp;\" ], # our workflow requires the vasp module to be loaded ) # Scale the cluster to the number of SLURM jobs that you'd like cluster . scale ( 10 ) # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- # STEP 2: Configure our Prefect Agent and start submitting workflows! from prefect.agent.local import LocalAgent from simmate.configuration.prefect.connect_to_dask import set_default_executor # We want Prefect to use our Dask Cluster to run all of the workflow tasks. To # tell Prefect to do this, we wrote a helper function that ships with Simmate. set_default_executor ( cluster . scheduler . address ) # Start our cluster! Our cluster's name is Warwulf, so we use that here. agent = LocalAgent ( name = \"WarWulf\" , labels = [ \"WarWulf\" ], ) # Now we can start the Prefect Agent which will run and search for jobs and then # submit them to our Dask cluster. agent . start () # NOTE: this line will run endlessly unless you set a timelimit in the LocalAgent above # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Test out your cluster by running simmate workflows run-cloud relaxation_mit POSCAR in a separate terminal (submit this a bunch if you'd like to). If you'd like to limit how many workflows of a given tag (e.g. \"WarWulf\" above) run in parallel, set the concurrency limit in Prefect cloud here . To let others use your cluster, simply add them to your Prefect Cloud and give them an API key. They just need to do the following: set your Prefect backend with the command prefect backend cloud tell Prefect your key with the command prefect auth login --key example_key_h123j2jfk try submitting a workflow with simmate workflows run-cloud relaxation_mit POSCAR","title":"The quick tutorial"},{"location":"getting_started/_Integrate_with_Prefect_and_Dask/#the-full-tutorial","text":"","title":"The full tutorial"},{"location":"getting_started/_Integrate_with_Prefect_and_Dask/#a-review-of-concepts","text":"Recall from tutorial 2, there are 4 steps to a workflow: - configure : chooses our desired settings for the calculation (such as VASP's INCAR settings) - schedule : decides whether to run the workflow immediately or send off to a job queue (e.g. SLURM, PBS, or remote computers) - execute : writes our input files, runs the calculation (e.g. calling VASP), and checks the results for errors - save : saves the results to our database This tuturial will give an overview of how to modify the schedule and determine which computer execute is called on. Up until now, we have been using the default behavior for these two steps. But now we want to instead do the following: - schedule : submits the workflow to a scheduler queue of many other workflows - execute : run the calculation on a remote cluster A scheduler is something we submit workflows to and controls when to run them. As a bunch of workflows are submitted, our scheduler forms a queue and keeps track of which ones to run next. We will use Prefect as our scheduler. A cluster is a group of computational resources that actually run the workflows. So our scheduler will find whichever workflow should be ran next, and send it to our cluster to run. Clusters are often made up of \"workers\" -- where a worker is just a single resource and it works through one job at a time. For example, if we had a cluster made up of 10 desktop computers, each computer would run a workflow and once finished ask the scheduler for the next workflow to run. At any given time, 10 workflows will be running. We'll use Dask to set up our cluster, whether your resources are on the cloud, a supercomputer, or just simple desktops.","title":"A review of concepts"},{"location":"getting_started/_Integrate_with_Prefect_and_Dask/#should-i-set-up-my-own-cluster","text":"Before we start... We understand that resource restrictions can be very stingent between labs and companies. So sharing resources is not possible, even in close collaborations. Simmate addresses this issue by making it easy to share a cloud database without sharing computational resources. In other words, you can contribute to a shared database without letting others see/access your computational resources. With that said, each team will likely need to handle their own computational resources, which can be any number of things: - a university or federal HPC cluster with SLURM, PBS, or some other queue system - a single node or even a Kubernetes cluster provided by a commercial service like DigitalOcean, GoogleCloud, etc. - a series of desktop computers that your lab shares - any combination of these resources The easiest way to use these resources is to sign on and run simmate directly on it. When this is done, the workflow runs directly on your resource and it will run there immediately. We've already see this with Tutorial 2 when we called simmate workflows run ... . Just use that on your new resource to start! (for help signing on to remote supercomputers and installing anaconda, be sure to ask the cluster's IT team). As another example, you can submit a workflow to a SLURM cluster with a submit.sh file like this: #!/bin/bash #SBATCH --output=slurm.out #SBATCH --nodes=1 #SBATCH --ntasks=2 # make sure you have you activated your conda enviornment # and required modules before submitting simmate workflows run-cloud relaxation_mit POSCAR > simmate.out If you are only running a few workflows per day (<10), we recommend you stick to running workflows in this way. That is, just calling simmate workflows run . Don't overcomplicate things. Alternatively, if your team is submitting hundreds or thousands of workflows at a time, then it would be extremely useful to monitor and orchestrate these workflows. To do this, we will use Prefect and Dask. Just like with our cloud database in the previous tutorial, you only need ONE person to manage ALL of your computational resources. Once the resources have been set up, the other users can connect using API key (which is essentially a username+password).","title":"Should I set up my own cluster?"},{"location":"getting_started/_Integrate_with_Prefect_and_Dask/#setting-up-your-scheduler-with-prefect","text":"The first half of this section is just a replica of Prefect's tutorial, but rewritten in a condensed format. If you prefer, you can use their tutorial instead: Introduction to Prefect Orchestration With Prefect as our scheduler, we have two options on how to set this up: Prefect Cloud or Prefect Server. They give a guide on which to choose here , but to summarize: - Prefect Server is free and open-source, but it requires you set up a server and manage it independently - Prefect Cloud is free for your first 20,000 workflow tasks each month (here's their pricing page ) and all set up for you Our team uses Prefect Cloud and recommends that beginners do the same. Unless you are running dozens of [evolutionary searches] per month, you won't come close to the 20,000 workflow task-run limit. This tutorial will continue with Prefect Cloud, but if you decide on Prefect Server , you'll have to set that up before continuing. Go ahead and sign in to Prefect Cloud (use your github account if you have one!). Everything will be empty to start, so we want to add all of Simmate's workflows to our interface here. To do this, we need an API key, which acts like a username and password. It's how we tell python that we now have a Prefect account. To get your API key, go to Prefect Cloud's homepage and navigate to User -> Account Settings -> API Keys -> Create An API Key . Copy the created API key. On your computer, open a terminal and make sure you have your conda enviornment active. Prefect is already installed because the installation of Simmate did it for us. So run the command: prefect backend cloud . This just tells prefect that we decided to use their scheduler. Next, run the command prefect auth login --key example_key_h123j2jfk where you replace the end text with your copied API KEY. We can now use Simmate to access your cloud and submit workflows for us! To get started, we need to add all of our workflows to Prefect. This is done with simmate workflow-engine setup-cloud . After running this, you should see all of the workflow in your Prefect Cloud now! If you were to use the simmate workflows run command that we've been using, you'll notice it still runs directly on your computer. To instead submit it to Prefect Cloud, use the command simmate workflows run-cloud instead. So for an example workflow, the full command would be... simmate workflows run-cloud relaxation_mit POSCAR . When you use run-cloud , the workflow run shows up in your Prefect Cloud, but it's not running. That is because we need a Prefect \"Agent\" -- an Agent simply checks for workflows that need to be ran and submits them to a cluster of computational resources. Let's start a Prefect Agent with all default settings (no cluster is attached yet), which means it will simply run the workflow on whichever computer the agent is on. To do this, run the command prefect agent local start . You'll see it pick up the workflow we submitted with run-cloud and run it. Even after the job completes, the agent will continue to run. So if you submit a new workflow, it will run it as well. We skimmed over a lot of the fundamentals for Prefect here, so we highly recommend going through Prefect's guides and tutorials . Spending a day or two on this will save you a lot of headache down the road.","title":"Setting up your scheduler with Prefect"},{"location":"getting_started/_Integrate_with_Prefect_and_Dask/#setting-up-your-cluster-with-dask","text":"Because there is such a diverse set of computational resources that teams can have, we can't cover all setup scenarios in this tutorial. Instead, we will go through some examples of submitting Simmate workflows to a Dask cluster. This will all be on your local computer. For switching to remote resources (and job queue clusters like SLURM), we can only point you to key tutorials and documentation on how to set up your cluster. You can ask our team which setup is the best fit for your team, and we'll try to guide you through the process. Setting up your cluster shouldn't take longer than a hour, so post a question if you're struggling! Here are some useful resources for setting up a cluster with Dask. We recommend going through these before trying to use Dask with Simmate: - Introduction to Dask Futures - This is the best tutorial to start with! Then go through their example . Dask can do a lot, but Simmate only really uses this feature. If you understand how to use the client.submit , then you understand how Simmate is using Dask - Introduction to Dask Jobqueue - If you use a queue system like PBS, Slurm, MOAB, SGE, LSF, and HTCondor, then this will show you how to set up a cluster on your resource. Here's a simple example of using Dask to run a function that \"sleeps\" for 1 second import time # This loop will take 60 seconds to complete for n in range ( 60 ): # run this 60 times time . sleep ( 1 ) # sleeps 1 second # Now we switch to using Dask from dask.distributed import Client client = Client () # Futures are basically our \"job_id\". They let us check the status and result futures = [] for n in range ( 60 ): # run this 60 times # submits time.sleep(1) to Dask. pure=False tells Dask to rerun each instead # of loading past results from each time.sleep(1). future = client . submit ( time . sleep , 1 , pure = False ) futures . append ( future ) # now wait for all the jobs to finish # This will take much less than 60 seconds! results = [ future . result () for future in futures ] We'll now try using Dask to run our Simmate workflows.","title":"Setting up your cluster with Dask"},{"location":"getting_started/_Integrate_with_Prefect_and_Dask/#in-serial-one-item-at-time","text":"Let's start with how we've been submitting workflows: using workflow.run .

Many research teams around the world have built databases made of 100,000+ structures -- and many of these teams even ran calculations on all of them. Here, we will use Simmate to explore their data. Loading a table \u00b6 Let's start with one of the smaller databases out there: JARVIS . It may be smaller than the others, but their dataset still includes ~56,000 structures! Simmate makes the download for all of these under 0.01 GB. In the previous section, we loaded our DatabaseTable from the workflow. But now we don't have a workflow... We just want to grab the table directly. To do this we run the following: # This line MUST be ran before any tables can be loaded from simmate.database import connect # this connects to our database # This gives the database_table we were using in the previous section from simmate.database.workflow_results import StaticEnergy # This loads the table where we store all of the JARVIS data. from simmate.database.third_parties import JarvisStructure table from the previous section and the MITRelaxation class here are the exact same class. These are just different ways of loading it. While loading a workflow sets up a database connection for us, we have the do that step manually here (with from simmate.database import connect ). When loading database tables directly from the simmate.database module, the most common error is forgetting to connect to your database. So don't forget to include from simmate.database import connect ! Filling data \u00b6 Now that we have our datatable class ( JarvisStructure ) loaded, let's check if there's any data in it: JarvisStructure . objects . count () Note If you accepted the download during the simmate database reset command, then you should see that there are thousands of structures already in this database table! If the count gives 0, then that means you still need to load data. We can quickly load all of the data using the load_remote_archive method. Behind the scenes, this is downloading the JARVIS data from simmate.org and moving it into your database. This can take ~10 minutes because we are actually saving all these structures to your computer -- that way, you can rapidly load these structures in under 1 second in the future. # NOTE: This line is only needed if you did NOT accept the download # when running `simmate database reset`. JarvisStructure . load_remote_archive () # This may take ~10min to complete Warning It is very important that you read the warnings printed by load_remote_archive . This data was NOT made by Simmate. We are just helping to distribute it on behalf of these other teams. Be sure to cite them for their work! Calling load_remote_archive loads ALL data to your computer and saves it. This data will not be updated unless you call load_remote_archive again. This should only be done every time we release a new archive version (typically once per year). To protect our servers from misuse, you can only call load_remote_archive() a few times per month -- no matter what. Don't overuse this feature.

FloatField () Next, we want a separate table to contain this type of information and more: class Student ( Person ): # <--- note we have Person here instead of DatabaseTable year = table_columns . IntField () # e.g. class of 2020 gpa = table_columns . FloatField () The Student datatable now looks like this: name age height year gpa jack 15 6.1 2020 3.6 lauren 16 5.8 2019 4.0 siona 15 5.6 2020 3.7 scott 14 6.2 2021 3.2 ... ... ... ... ... Simmate uses this idea with common materials science data -- such as structures, thermodynamic data, site forces, and more. You'll find our fundamental building blocks for tables in the simmate.database.base_data_types module ( here ) All of our datatables start from these classes and build up.

For this tutorial, we will use the SimmateExecutor because it is the default one and it's already set up for us. What is a cluster \u00b6 A cluster is a group of computational resources that actually run the workflows. So our scheduler will find whichever workflow should be ran next, and send it to our cluster to run. Clusters are often made up of workers -- where a worker is just a single resource and it works through one job at a time. For example, say we have 10 computers (or slurm jobs) that each run one workflow at a time. All computers together are our cluster. Each computer is a worker.

Note that Simmate is still early in development, so there are many more features available through PyMatGen and MatMiner packages, which were installed alongside Simmate. Example 1: Structure Creation \u00b6 Simmate's toolkit is (at the moment) most useful for structure creation. This includes creating structures from random symmetry, prototype structures, and more. We only need to give these \"creator\" classes a composition object: from simmate.toolkit import Composition from simmate.toolkit.creators import RandomSymStructure composition = Composition ( \"Ca2N\" ) creator = RandomSymStructure ( composition ) structure1 = creator . create_structure ( spacegroup = 166 ) structure2 = creator . create_structure ( spacegroup = 225 ) Example 2: Fingerprint analysis \u00b6 Matminer is particularly useful for analyzing \"features\" of a structure and making machine-learning inputs. One common analysis gives the \"fingerprint\" of the structure, which helps characterize bonding in the crystal.

In real life, we might say that McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's are examples of restauraunts. In python, we could say that mcdonalds , burgerking , and wendys are objects of the class Restaurants . By organizing objects into class es, python simplifies the way we program. For example, we could design the Restaurants class to have a property called menu . Then, we could view the menu simply by typing wendys.menu . We (essentially) set a rule that -- no matter what restaurant we have -- the menu info can be accessed with example_restaurant.menu . This might seem silly, but it becomes very powerful once we want to start building out functionality and anaylses. In materials science, the class we use most is crystal structure. In Simmate, we call this class Structure . A crystal structure is always made up of a lattice and a list of atomic sites. Fortunately, this is exactly what we have in our POSCAR file from tutorial 2, so let's use Simmate to create an object of the Structure . Loading the Structure class \u00b6 Start by entering this line into the python console and hit enter: from simmate.toolkit import Structure This line says we want to use the Structure class from Simmate's code.

Spyder lists this in the top right -- and you can hit the folder icon to change it. We want to be in the same folder as our POSCAR file. Run this line in your python terminal: nacl_structure = Structure . from_file ( \"POSCAR\" ) Here, we told python that we have a Structure and the information for it is located in the POSCAR file. This could be in many other formats, such as a CIF file. But we now have a Structure object and it is named nacl_structure . To make sure it loaded correctly, run this line: nacl_structure It should print out...

In real life, we might say that McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's are examples of restauraunts. In python, we could say that mcdonalds , burgerking , and wendys are objects of the class Restaurants . By organizing objects into class es, python simplifies the way we program. For example, we could design the Restaurants class to have a property called menu . Then, we could view the menu simply by typing wendys.menu . We (essentially) set a rule that -- no matter what restaurant we have -- the menu info can be accessed with example_restaurant.menu . This might seem silly, but it becomes very powerful once we want to start building out functionality and anaylses. In materials science, the class we use most is crystal structure. In Simmate, we call this class Structure . A crystal structure is always made up of a lattice and a list of atomic sites.

So there is no error handling and no results # will be saved to your database. vasp_std > vasp.out OPTION 2: Using the \"customized\" workflow for a calculator (e.g. customized.vasp.user-config ) # In a file named \"my_example.yaml\". # Indicates we want to change the settings, using a specific workflow as a starting-point workflow_name : customized.vasp.user-config workflow_base : static-energy.vasp.mit # \"Updated settings\" indicated that we are updating some class attribute. # These fundamentally change the settings of a workflow. # Currently, only updating dictionary-based attributes are supported updated_settings : incar : ENCUT : 600 KPOINTS : 0.25 potcar_mappings : Y : Y_sv # Then the remaining inputs are the same as the base workflow input_parameters : structure : POSCAR command : mpirun -n 5 vasp_std > vasp.out # Now run our workflow from the settings file above. # Results will be stored in a separate table from the # base workflow's results. simmate workflows run-yaml my_example.yaml Both of these approaches are only suitable for customizing settings for a few calculations -- and also you lose some key Simmate features.

But have you ever updated your operating system and then everything else on your computer goes haywire? With python, the chances of that happening are extremely high, so we want to be careful. For example, say I wanted two packages installed: Simmate version 1.0, which requires python version 3.10 or greater Numpy version 1.15, which requires python version 2.7 The conflicting versions of python creates a problem. To solve this, we use Anaconda . Anaconda installs python and all of our extra packages, including Simmate. To make sure nothing ever breaks, it separates each of our installations into folders known as \"environments\". So using our example programs, we could have two environments: one named \"simmate_env\" and another named \"numpy_env\" (these can be named anything). The two different python versions and codes would be installed into separate folders so that they don't interact. Package versions can also conflict with each other. For example, Simmate requires the package Django (version >3.2), so if you installed Django 2.0, it would break your Simmate installation. Therefore, Anaconda prevents you from installing conflicting versions within a single environment. Installing Anaconda and a first look \u00b6 For this tutorial, we'll install Anaconda to your local desktop/laptop. Even if you'll be using a university supercomputer (or some other remote computer system) to run workflows, stick to your local computer. We'll switch to your remote supercomputer near the end of tutorial 02. To install Anaconda, you don't need to make an account on their website. Just use their download page and install Anaconda (individual edition). Use all of the default options when installing. Open the application when you're done! The application will be called \"Anaconda Navigator\". On the homescreen, you'll see several IDEs, such as Orange3, Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, and others. These IDEs are for you to write your own python code. Just like how there is Microsoft Word, Google Docs, LibreOffice, and others for writing papers, all of these IDEs are different ways to write python. Our prefered IDE is Spyder , which we will introduce in tutorial 03. On the left, you'll see an \"Environments\" tab. Go ahead and open it. When you first install Anaconda, there will only be a \"base\" environment that already has popular packages installed. You can create new environments here and install new packages into each -- all without affecting what's already installed. That's really it to the Anaconda interface! While we can install Simmate with this interface, it's actually even easier with the command-line. The remainder of this tutorial will use the command-line instead of the Anaconda Navigator interface.

But have you ever updated your operating system and then everything else on your computer goes haywire? With python, the chances of that happening are extremely high, so we want to be careful. For example, say I wanted two packages installed: Simmate version 1.0, which requires python version 3.10 or greater Numpy version 1.15, which requires python version 2.7 The conflicting versions of python creates a problem. To solve this, we use Anaconda . Anaconda installs python and all of our extra packages, including Simmate. To make sure nothing ever breaks, it separates each of our installations into folders known as \"environments\". So using our example programs, we could have two environments: one named \"simmate_env\" and another named \"numpy_env\" (these can be named anything). The two different python versions and codes would be installed into separate folders so that they don't interact. Package versions can also conflict with each other. For example, Simmate requires the package Django (version >3.2), so if you installed Django 2.0, it would break your Simmate installation. Therefore, Anaconda prevents you from installing conflicting versions within a single environment.","title":"Why Anaconda?"},{"location":"getting_started/installation/install_anaconda/#installing-anaconda-and-a-first-look","text":"For this tutorial, we'll install Anaconda to your local desktop/laptop.

It's not as clean and tidy as a POSCAR, but it holds similar information: data_NaCl _symmetry_space_group_name_H-M 'P 1' _cell_length_a 4.02463542 _cell_length_b 4.02463542 _cell_length_c 4.02463542 _cell_angle_alpha 60.00000000 _cell_angle_beta 60.00000000 _cell_angle_gamma 60.00000000 _symmetry_Int_Tables_number 1 _chemical_formula_structural NaCl _chemical_formula_sum 'Na1 Cl1' _cell_volume 46.09614833 _cell_formula_units_Z 1 loop_ _symmetry_equiv_pos_site_id _symmetry_equiv_pos_as_xyz 1 'x, y, z' loop_ _atom_site_type_symbol _atom_site_label _atom_site_symmetry_multiplicity _atom_site_fract_x _atom_site_fract_y _atom_site_fract_z _atom_site_occupancy Na Na0 1 0.00000000 0.00000000 0.00000000 1 Cl Cl1 1 0.50000000 0.50000000 0.50000000 1 Nearly all files that you will interact with are text files -- just in different formats. That's where file extensions come in. They indicate what format we are using. Files named something.cif just tell programs we have a text file written in the CIF structure format. VASP uses the name POSCAR (without any file extension) to show its format. So rename your file from POSCAR.txt to POSCAR , and now all programs (VESTA, OVITO, and others) will know what to do with your structure. In Windows, you will often receive a warning about changing the file extension. Ignore the warning and change the extension. If you're using the command-line to create/edit this file, you can use the copy ( cp ) command to make the POSCAR file: cp POSCAR.txt POSCAR We now have our structure ready to go! Fun-fact a Microsoft Word document is just a folder of text files. The .docx file ending tells Word that we have the folder in their desired format. Try renaming a word file from my_file.docx to my_file.zip and open it up to explore. Nearly all programs do something like this!","title":"Making a structure file"},{"location":"getting_started/run_a_workflow/quick_start/","text":"Run a workflow \u00b6 In this tutorial, you will use the command line to view all available workflows and their settings.

If you can, try to sit down with an experienced user or someone from your IT department as you work through it. Don't get discouraged if this section takes your more than an hour -- it's a lot to learn! Thus far, you've been running Simmate on your local desktop or laptop, but we saw in the previous section, that we actually need VASP (which needs to be on Linux) for Simmate's workflows to run. 99% of the time, you'll be using a University or Federal supercomputer (aka \"high performance computing (HPC) clusters\"), which will have VASP already installed. A check-list before starting \u00b6 For teams that are actively using Simmate, we have a guides on submitting to that particular cluster. Check to see if your university or federal cluster is listed . Use these guides as you work through the rest of this section. If your cluster/university is not listed, contact your IT team for help in completing this tutorial. For workflows to run correctly, the following requirements need to be met: a VASP license for your team ( purchased on their site ) a remote cluster that you have a profile with (e.g. UNC's LongLeaf ) VASP installed on the remote cluster Anaconda installed on the remote cluster Simmate installed on the remote cluster VASP Potentials in ~/simmate/vasp/Potentials on the remote cluster The remainder of this tutorial gives example commands to use. Replace these commands and scripts with the ones in your cluster's guide. (For example, the next command titled \"Sign in with...\", you should use the \"Sign in with...\" section of your cluster's guide.) Sign in to the cluster \u00b6 If you've never signed into a remote cluster before, we will do this by using SSH (Secure Shell). For example, to sign in to University of North Carolina's LongLeaf cluster, you would run the following command in your local terminal (on windows, use your Command-prompt -- not the Anaconda Powershell Prompt): # Sign in with... ssh my_username@longleaf.unc.edu After entering your password, you are now using a terminal on the remote supercomputer. Try running the command pwd (\"print working directory\") to show that your terminal is indeed running commands on the remote cluster, not your desktop: # This is the same for all linux clusters pwd Load VASP \u00b6 To load VASP into your environment, you typically need to run the command: # Load VASP with... module load vasp # then check the command is found vasp_std If the vasp_std command worked correctly, you will see the following output (bc their command doesn't print help information like simmate or conda ): # Error output may vary between different VASP versions Error reading item 'VCAIMAGES' from file INCAR. Install Simmate on the cluster \u00b6 Next we need to ensure Simmate is installed. If you see (base) at the start of your command-line, Anaconda is already installed! If not, ask your IT team how they want you install it (typically it's by using miniconda which is just anaconda without the graphical user interface). With Anaconda set up, you can create your environment and install Simmate just like we did in tutorial 01: # Create your conda env with... conda create -n my_env -c conda-forge python = 3 .10 simmate conda activate my_env # Initialize your database on this new installation. simmate database reset Set up Potentials \u00b6 Next, copy your Potentials into ~/simmate/vasp/Potentials and also copy the POSCAR file above onto your cluster. It can be diffult in the command line to move files around or even transfer them back and forth from your local computer to the supercomputer. It's much easier with a program like FileZilla , MobaXTerm , or another file transfer window. We recommend FileZilla, but it's entirely optional and up to you. Typically, clusters will have a \"scratch\" directory that you should submit jobs from -- which is different from your home directory. Make sure you switch to that before submitting and workflows. (note, your POSCAR should be in this directory too). Here is what LongLeaf's looks like as an example: # Access scratch directory with... cd /pine/scr/j/a/jacksund Submit a workflow to the queue \u00b6 Finally, let's submit a Simmate workflow on our cluster! In the previous section, we called simmate workflows run ... directly in our terminal, but this should NEVER be done on a supercomputer. Instead we should submit the workflow to the cluster's job queue. Typically, supercomputers use SLURM or PBS to submit jobs. For example, UNC's longleaf cluster uses SLURM . To submit, we would make a file named submit.sh : # Create a SLURM script with... nano submit.sh ... and use contents likes ... #! /bin/sh #SBATCH --job-name=my_example_job #SBATCH --nodes=1 #SBATCH --ntasks=1 #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4 #SBATCH --mem=4GB #SBATCH --time=01:00:00 #SBATCH --partition=general #SBATCH --output=slurm.out #SBATCH --mail-type=ALL #SBATCH --mail-user=my_username@live.unc.edu simmate workflows run static-energy.vasp.mit --structure POSCAR --command \"mpirun -n 4 vasp_std > vasp.out\" Each of these SBATCH parameters set how we would like to sumbit a job and how many resources we expect to use. These are explained in SLURM's documnetation for sbatch , but you may need help from your IT team to update them. But to break down these example parameters... job-name : the name that identifies your job. It will be visible when you check the status of your job nodes : the number of server nodes (or CPUs) that you request. Typically leave this at 1. ntasks : the number tasks that you'll be running. We run one workflow at a time here, so we use 1. cpus-per-task : the number of CPU tasks required for each run. We run our workflow using 4 cores ( mpirun -n 4 ) so we need to request 4 cores for it here mem : the memory requested for this job. If it is exceeded, the job will be terminated. time : the maximum time requested for this job. If it is exceeded, the job will be terminated. partition : the group of nodes that we request resources on. You can often remove this line and use the cluster's default. output : the name of the file to write the job output (including errors) mail-type + mail-user : will send an email alerts when a jobs starts/stops/fails/etc. Make sure you have VASP and your correct conda enviornment loaded. Then submit your job with: # Submit with... sbatch submit.sh Monitor its progress \u00b6 You can then monitor your jobs progress with: # Monitor progress with... squeue -u my_username You've now submitted a Simmate workflow to a remote cluster !!! Tip Be sure to go back through this section a few times before moving on. Submitting remote jobs can be tedious but it's important to understand. Advanced features of Simmate will let you skip a lot of this work down the road, but that won't happen until we reaching the \"Adding Computational Resources\" guide.","title":"Submit to a cluster"},{"location":"getting_started/run_a_workflow/submit_to_a_cluster/#switching-to-a-remote-cluster","text":"Warning This section can be extremely difficult for beginners.
